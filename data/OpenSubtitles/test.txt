553  We were stationed together .	 See , that\xc2\xb4s beautiful .
556  You think we\xc2\xb4re lovers ?	 No , no .
557  We\xc2\xb4re not gay .	 Oh , God .
558  I\xc2\xb4m sorry .	 - I just assumed .
560  - You\xc2\xb4re divorced .	 - That\xc2\xb4s a nice way ofputting it .
561  I call it being dumped .	 I was ... dumped once .
564  When actually ... it hurts more .	 You know what we need ?
565  What do we need ?	 We need drinks .
566  We need a lot ofdrinks .	 Garcon .
567  You still go to church ?	 Every Sunday .

574  I was -- I was so angrywith her .	 I was like ...
575  " What about my plans ? "	 - You know ?
577  Wasn\xc2\xb4t that plan good enough for God ?	 Apparently not .
578  How aboutyou ?	 How\xc2\xb4d you lose your faith ?
579  A long time ago .	 One day Godjust stopped listening .
581  Well , I guess I don\xc2\xb4t .	 I hate thoughts like that .
585  - You wouldn\xc2\xb4t believe me ifl told you .	 - Try me .
586  All right , but I warned you .	 Okay .
587  I\xc2\xb4m going to this church in NewJersey .	 Really .
588  Kerwood Mandel to carthree .	 Kerwood Mandel to carthree .
590  Shit .	 They\xc2\xb4re trying to get back into Heaven .
593  Thank you .	 I feel so stupid ... just saying it .
596  Oh , yeah , right .	 Kill them .
599  I wake up and --	 - The apostle .
602  Just let her go .	 - We can talk about this .
605  Five minutes ago you were aching to top me off .	 Loki !
606  Holy shit .	 The apostle .
612  - It\xc2\xb4s not a matter ofpride !	 - Loki , kill the girl .
613  What areyou , high ?	 I can\xc2\xb4t kill her ifshe hasn\xc2\xb4t done anything .
614  Fine .	 I\xc2\xb4il kill her myself .
616  - Shut his mouth .	 Oh , shit !
617  Jay !	 Biggie !
618  The door !	 The door !
620  No ticket .	 - The apostle is here .
621  - I noticed .	 - Then you know who she was , don\xc2\xb4tyou ?
623  I mean , you heard the guy .	 He said there are consequences .
625  I was close .	 You know ?
626  I was so close to slitting that bitch\xc2\xb4s throat .	 Whoa .
627  You know how I felt ?	 Righteous .
628  Justified .	 Eager , even .
629  You all right ?	 Your eyes are kinda --
630  My eyes are open .	 For the first time I get it .
637  But no , we\xc2\xb4re servants .	 Okay .
643  What was the result ?	 Our expulsion from paradise .
644  Where was His infinite fucking patience then ?	 It\xc2\xb4s not right !
645  lt\xc2\xb4s not fair !	 We\xc2\xb4ve paid our debt !
646  Don\xc2\xb4tyou think it\xc2\xb4s time ?	 Don\xc2\xb4tyou think it\xc2\xb4s time we went home ?
648  Wait , wait .	 Kill them ?
650  Those guys were all right .	 Don\xc2\xb4t .
651  Don\xc2\xb4t , my friend .	 Don\xc2\xb4t letyour sympathies get the best of you .
653  No harm , no foul .	 My God .
654  I\xc2\xb4ve heard a rant like this before .	 What did you say ?
656  - You sound like the morning star .	 - You shutyour fucking face !
657  You sound like Lucifer , man !	 You\xc2\xb4ve fucking lost it !
661  Shit .	 Why couldn\xc2\xb4t we stay on the train ?
662  You threw those guys off .	 Very basic strategy .
670  1 2 to 30 .	 Now , that\xc2\xb4s some pretty bad storytelling .
675  - His mother and father .	 - His brothers and sisters .
676  Jesus didn\xc2\xb4t have brothers and sisters .	 Mary was a virgin .
682  I can\xc2\xb4t do this anymore .	 Whereyou gonna go ?
683  You know what l\xc2\xb4m saying is right .	 - It\xc2\xb4s bullshit .
684  - Bethany .	 It\xc2\xb4s bullshit !
685  Let her go , man .	 Give her time .
686  Why ?	 What the fuck do You want from me ?
687  I fucking hate You !	 I hate You .
688  He can\xc2\xb4t hear you , you know .	 That\xc2\xb4s whywe needed you .
689  Why didn\xc2\xb4tyou tell me ?	 Would you --
692  It\xc2\xb4s too big .	 That\xc2\xb4s what Jesus said .
695  He begged me to take it all back .	 As if i could .
697  Ifl had the power ...	 I would have .
699  I sympathize .	 I do .
700  I wish I could take it all back .	 But I can\xc2\xb4t .
701  This ... is whoyou are .	 Everything I am has been a lie ?
708  Weren\xc2\xb4t wejust in the woods ?	 What are we doing here now ?
709  Going out in style .	 - The voice .
710  - The apostle .	 Now , who\xc2\xb4s this motherfucker ?
711  The voice of God .	 Show some respect .
712  Oh , the voice ofGod .	 Where\xc2\xb4s the rest of Him ?
713  Funny you should mention that .	 We\xc2\xb4re not sure .
716  " Constitutionals " ?	 I think we\xc2\xb4re beyond euphemisms at this point .
722  He could\xc2\xb4ve been killed .	 Human form does have that drawback .
728  Could it be Lucifer ?	 Not Lucifer .
732  The guy in charge ofthe church thing .	 Cardinal Glick ?
734  Good Lord .	 The little stoner\xc2\xb4s got a point .
738  Excuse me .	 Fill them pews , people .
739  That\xc2\xb4s the key .	 Grab the little ones as well .
740  Hook \xc2\xb4em while they\xc2\xb4reyoung .	 - Kinda like the tobacco industry .
743  We\xc2\xb4d likeyou to cancel the ceremony .	 I beg your pardon .
748  Who sentyou ?	 We were sent by Him who is called I Am !
749  Cute .	 Really cute .
750  Playtime with the cardinal is over .	 - Worked for Moses .
751  - Stay out ofthis .	 It\xc2\xb4s not ajoke .
753  Please !	 What about the Church\xc2\xb4s silent consent ofthe slave trade ?
758  Don\xc2\xb4t worry about it .	 We evened the score .
759  Hand it over , Silent Bob .	 What up .
761  Cross- dressin\xc2\xb4 fuck .	 That\xc2\xb4s sort of sweet .
762  Thanks , guys .	 What do we do now about Bartleby and Loki ?
764  - Correction .	 Theywon\xc2\xb4t be killed .
766  and l\xc2\xb4m looking right at him .	 Muse !
767  Just in time to join us for a drink .	 Hey .
768  Where\xc2\xb4d you come from ?	 - Where\xc2\xb4d you come from ?
769  - Me ?	 Nothingness .
771  - Let\xc2\xb4s go .	 - Oh , darn it !
774  - None other than .	 - Who is he ?
775  All right , one drink .	 Then you\xc2\xb4re gone .
776  Give me a ...	 Holy Bartender .
777  Never heard ofit .	 He doesn\xc2\xb4t know how to make a Holy Bartender .
778  You do , don\xc2\xb4tyou , Muse ?	 Don\xc2\xb4t .
779  Anybody ?	 No ?
780  Well , I know how to make a Holy Bartender .	 Get it ?
781  Sweet Jesus , Azrael !	 Why ?
782  Come on , Demon !	 Try that shit on somebody who\xc2\xb4s already dead !
786  " Holy Bartender . " I get it .	 That\xc2\xb4s a great one !
789  God doesn\xc2\xb4t live here anymore .	 He\xc2\xb4s grown weary ofyour superficial faith .
792  - Maybe we shouldjust leave .	 - You wanted your body count .
793  You got it .	 This lot is rife with sin .
794  We\xc2\xb4il judge them all .	 Officer McGhee .
799  Now .	 - I\xc2\xb4m feeling a little exposed here .
800  Do it !	 - So he\xc2\xb4s a muse too ?
801  - Former muse .	 He was kicked out .
802  Ever the fucking apple polisher .	 Then what happened ?
807  What areyou , some kind offuckin\xc2\xb4 chicken ?	 No .
808  I was an artist ... stupid !	 I was inspiration !
811  Don\xc2\xb4t tell meyou never questioned the judgment , Serendipity .	 No .
812  It never bothered me .	 Soyou were an artist .
814  That\xc2\xb4s why he is the king ... and you\xc2\xb4re a schmuck .	 Nice .
816  After the first million years ?	 No .
818  Plenary indulgence .	 But I couldn\xc2\xb4t exercise it .
819  Demons can\xc2\xb4t become human .	 No , we can\xc2\xb4t transubstantiate .
820  But angels can .	 Bartleby and Loki .
823  Her .	 And how ?
826  I mean , hereyou all are .	 Powerless to stop the inevitable .
828  I think not .	 I\xc2\xb4d rather not exist than go back to that .
830  Now , now , now .	 Things are getting too intense in here .
831  Hey !	 What say we watch a little TV ?
832  Yo , put on channel 9 .	 Davey and Goliath .
837  God , no !	 You see that ?
839  Oh ?	 Oh , now what was that all about ?
840  What ?	 Oh , nothing .
841  I had something in my eye .	 Now who\xc2\xb4s the fucking child ?
843  You\xc2\xb4d have him assault me with a putter ?	 You want to play ?
844  Then we\xc2\xb4il play .	 One side , Red .
845  Go ahead , then .	 Pick it up .
846  Call it a gift .	 Come on .
847  That\xc2\xb4s it .	 Take a shot .

854  But l\xc2\xb4m a fucking demon .	 Whatjust happened ?
855  He said it himself :	 " l\xc2\xb4m a fucking demon . "
858  - You\xc2\xb4ve got the divine heritage .	 Sanctifying isjust one ofthe fringe benefits .
861  - Ten steps ahead ofyou .	 Take the bartender\xc2\xb4s car .
864  Are we too late ?	 To save these poor schmucks ?
865  Yeah .	 But we still exist .
866  Where are they ?	 They could already be in the church .
867  Which means ifthey come out , nobody touches them .	 Areyou shitting me ?
870  And hello !	 We know what happens then , right ?
871  - Why don\xc2\xb4t theyjust kill themselves ?	 - It\xc2\xb4s a mortal sin .
875  It\xc2\xb4s one ofthem !	 Kill that motherfucker !
876  Don\xc2\xb4tyou listen ?	 - We can\xc2\xb4t touch him !
877  - I wasn\xc2\xb4t .	 I was gonna shoot his ass .
878  He\xc2\xb4s been at it for a while now .	 Please !
881  Whoops .	 Take a step back .
882  Let me go !	 Why ?
883  What are you trying to prove ?	 - All these people !
884  - Hey , this wasn\xc2\xb4t my idea !	 Jesus Christ !
888  Now look at him .	 This guy\xc2\xb4s fuckin\xc2\xb4 drunker than hell .
889  Which means he\xc2\xb4s human now .	 His wings have been cut off .
890  The muse ?	 Oh , no way !

892  What\xc2\xb4s with the tits ?	 Can l --

895  He\xc2\xb4s back .	 We were awaiting your arrival .
896  Bartleby , wait .	 Stop .
897  Listen to me .	 You can\xc2\xb4t go through with this .
898  Azrael wasjust using you .	 If you go back --
899  I\xc2\xb4ve become aware of the repercussions .	 I know what l\xc2\xb4m doing .
900  You sick , twisted fuck !	 Bethany .

918  - Amen to that .	 What the hell are you doing ?
922  Make with the love .	 It\xc2\xb4s a nice way of saying boning .
926  - Where is it ?	 - Asbury Park , about five miles away .
927  - Haveyou ever been there ?	 - Once , with this chick .
929  - Yeah .	 That\xc2\xb4s what l\xc2\xb4m talkin\xc2\xb4 about .

155  Do you read a bit ?	 No , it tires you .
156  Should I try to find her ?	 Berthelot and Roy have hired me .
157  I design gun barrel casings .	 That way I feel useful .
159  When I paint , I\' m in another world .	 Draw me
160  No , I can\' t .	 Why are you here ?
161  You can\' t stay here .	 Off you go !
163  Suddenly , a hail of bullets .	 Two Krauts .
164  I never saw them coming .	 My plane caught fire .
165  This tree came up at me .	 The rest\' s a blank .
166  Your uncle\' s downstairs .	 Please ...
167  He wants to reassure your mother .	 What shall I tell him ?
168  You can\' t hide forever .	 We\' il pill through

171  " Our uncle came .	 I warned you they\' d turn him away .
174  I\' ve brought you some cigarettes .	 Nice smell ?
177  " Sometimes ,	 " I forget I\' ve been woinded . "
178  How\' s the graft taking ?	 You\' il have a Greek nose .
179  No , a Jewish one .	 All right ...
181  Open your mouth .	 Speak .
182  What\' s your name ?	 Henri ...

184  I\' m operating tomorrow .	 A baby died last night .
186  It\' s a world first .	 Medicine is making giant strides .
187  Can I speak ?	 I can\' t do it .
188  I\' il never manage it .	 It\' s no use ...
189  It hirts .	 Are you all right ?
190  There\' s a corpse in my mouth .	 Does it hurt ?
191  I wish it was daytime .	 I\' m scared .
192  I\' m going to pray for you .	 You\' il be all right .
193  I don\' t believe in God .	 It\' s absurd .
195  - What\' s all this ?	 - It\' s him .
196  His face gives me nightmares .	 How do you feel today ?
198  There was a bit of flirting going on downstairs .	 C\xc3\xa9cile ...
201  I\' il be right back .	 I\' il find her .
203  This girl\' s pretty .	 I want to touch her .
204  Sorry , did I hurt you ?	 Why is it hirting today ?
205  I mistn\' t think about the pain .	 Is that better ?
206  Her skin\' s so soft ...
2  In which epoch ?	 Jean Cocteau said ;
4  The Dream of the Python	 I salute you , people of Koumbi .
6  I salute you all .	 I am grateful to you all .
7  I salute Kaya Maghan and his people .	 Woman !
8  The night belongs to spirits , the day belongs to doings .	 Listen !
9  Hear you not the thunderbolt ?	 See you not the whirlwind ?
10  Trapped !	 Koumbi , you are trapped !
12  But I , Kerfa , am not impressed .	 I fear nothing !
13  Misery !	 Misery !
14  He who sows misery , reaps but penury !	 Misery !
15  Misery !	 He who sows misery , reaps but penury !
16  Kaya Maghan , your reign is eternal ?	 False !
17  Most false !	 I say it loud and clear .
18  And I say it once again !	 Let go of me !
19  See ?	 They fear my tongue yet they break my nose !
20  See the blood ?	 Look !
21  Look !	 Kerfa , you are unreasonable .
22  What have you been saying ?	 Beware of those people .
23  The vulture does not sing .	 The hyena does not dance .
24  People of Koumbi , wake up !	 Sleep does not rule this world !
25  Goats who would be free !	 Orphaned ewes !
26  Hide yourselves !	 Stay away !
27  Be gone !	 The cruel feast of Kaya Maghan begins !
28  Our customs are fundamental .	 Most true .
29  Their root is memory .	 Their fruit is the given word .
30  Welcome , honourable priests .	 So the big day has come !
31  Indeed .	 The oracles have spoken ...
37  Forgive me .	 But Sia Yatabere is not free of engagements .
43  We cannot rob Mamadi of his betrothed .	 Rob ...
44  We are robbing nothing !	 We are acting for the good of all !
46  Out of the question .	 I have not blasphemed .
48  - He is procrastinating .	 - Humiliating us .
49  Enough !	 What has been said shall be done .
51  Mamadi shall be informed after the sacrifice .	 What is it ?
52  Nothing serious .	 Then speak .
53  The priests came to see us ...	 We know .
54  Indeed ...	 They brought news to the palace .
56  After consultation with the oracles ,	 Sia Yatabere , has been chosen ...
57  Your daughter .	 Balla , this news is overwhelming .
59  Of the Yatabere nobles , you are a thoroughbred ,	 Yatabere .
61  We will come for her .	 Yatabere .
63  What ?	 My daughter is to die and I must hold my tongue !
64  That beats everything !	 You too will die ...
65  Death spares no one .	 We all die one day .
66  But Sia\' s death is honourable .	 Sia !
67  Sia , where are you going ?	 Do not flee .
68  Wait , listen to me .	 Sia , my daughter ...
69  Hey man , it seems that last night	 Sia ran away .
70  It\' s great !	 I hope she holds out .
72  What ?	 Blaspheming ?
74  Mind your language , okay ?	 You\' re taking risks ...
77  Never !	 Never ever !
79  Yatabere !	 Worthy son of nobility !
81  What ?	 Fled ?
82  That\' s impossible !	 Where has she gone ?
83  We looked for her , without success .	 Search every room !
85  - Well ?	 - She\' s not there .
86  Not anywhere .	 Nowhere to be found .
87  We\' il be back .	 Find her !
88  - Where\' s your friend Sia ?	 - I\' ve no idea !
89  Let go of my daughter , she knows nothing !	 Take her away .
90  She\' s in cahoots !	 Where is Sia ?
91  Grandmother , where is she ?	 Search the house .
92  - No sign .	 - Let\' s go .
93  Misery !	 Misery !
95  What shall you do ?	 Will you too pursue and deliver up Sia ?
97  Do you understand ?	 We have sought Sia in vain .
98  No trace of her in the town .	 What ?
99  You dare say that to my face ?	 Bunch of good- for- nothings !
101  Arrest her parents immediately and all possible accomplices .	 Away with you !
104  People of Koumbi ...	 Python- God !
105  God who devours his children !	 His most beautiful daughters !
107  Be gone !	 All our daughters are beautiful !
109  Did you hear ?	 Break the skull of that blasphemer !
110  We have orders not to touch him .	 Do not fear death !
111  Death spares no one ,	 If you are afraid , you will die ,
113  Sacrificing human beings , how appalling ,	 Human life is sacred !
114  I declare it , most solemnly !	 Sacrificing human beings , how appalling ,
115  Misery !	 Misery !
116  He who sows misery , reaps but penury !	 Men and women !
117  Heed what I say !	 Listen to the good news from the palace .
119  Men and women of Koumbi !	 Informers !
120  May you be cursed to damnation !	 Kaya Maghan !
121  Master of the Universe !	 No need to hurry !
123  Completely drowned !	 Be patient , you wretch .
125  Wakhane .	 I want her at my feet ... without delay .
127  And you let him do it .	 You must understand .
133  Repeat :	 Kaya Maghan the benefactor !
134  Python- God the saviour !	 They give us rain !
135  They give us gold !	 They protect us !
136  Very well .	 Lock them up .
137  And make them talk .	 Twins !
139  Soldiers !	 With one exception .
140  Kerfa !	 Don\' t touch him .
141  He continually insults the emperor !	 Do not touch him !
142  I said , not a hair on his head !	 Is that clear ?
143  It\' s clear .	 - Arrest them !
144  - It\' s him !	 - Who ?
145  - You !	 Why ?
146  Let me go !	 Take them away !
147  Let go of me !	 Mercy !
148  That\' il do !	 I know you regularly hold subversive meetings .
149  True or false ?	 This farce has gone on long enough .
151  Take them away !	 Mercy !
152  Bring forth Sia\' s parents !	 Who are Sia\' s parents ?
153  Leave them be !	 They are innocent .
154  Bunch of cowards !	 Did you hear ?
155  I wasn\' t dreaming !	 She insulted us !
158  They\' ve got balls .	 And you have none !
159  This girl is possessed .	 Lock the witch up !
160  On your feet !	 So ?
161  Still don\' t want to confess ?	 We know nothing .
166  I am not mad !	 Wakhane knows what I mean !
167  Let them go .	 What ?
170  It\' s a subtle strategy !	 Wakhane is hiding something from you .
171  Nothing !	 Wakhane can hide nothing from me .
173  Fine !	 Don\' t say I didn\' t warn you .
175  Perhaps you know .	 Good- for- nothing !
176  She is not here .	 She wouldn\' t hide out with a madman .
178  Kerfa , I\' m afraid .	 Kerfa , listen .
180  I don\' t want to die .	 No one wants to die .
181  Who told you you\' re going to die ?	 It\' s done !
182  Come , it\' s really good .	 A delicious cat !
183  - No , I\' m not hungry .	 - Then hide .
184  You said they\' d not be back !	 Did I say that ?
185  Perhaps it\' s true !	 But nothing is sure .
186  It all depends .	 It\' s red hot !
187  I don\' t want to die .	 Then , you\' il not die !
189  Her fianc\xc3\xa9 hastened to save her .	 But Sia refused to flee .
192  If you still live .	 But you said I won\' t die .
193  I fear for my parents ...	 What does this story hold for them ?
194  What does it hold for them ?	 They will be forgotten .
196  - I\' ve just seen Sia .	 - Where ?
197  In Kerfa the madman\' s hut .	 Did anyone else see her ?
198  No , no one .	 Then don\' t tell a soul .
200  Does Mamadi know I\' m in danger ?	 Mamadi ?
201  Who is Mamadi ?	 My fianc\xc3\xa9 !
202  You just spoke of him ...	 He\' il come to save me .
203  Oh yes !	 Mamadi !
204  He will come , but you won\' t get far .	 Why not ?
206  Me ?	 What matter !
208  Well ?	 If your men don\' t find Sia , choose another girl !
210  It shall be Sia .	 I gave my word .
212  Well said !	 So what do you intend to do ?
213  You speak of authority ?	 You have no more authority !
214  The people are party to this flight .	 Your authority\' s been ridiculed .
218  The water quells the fire !	 The sand drinks the water !
220  The greatest of great heroes , Cisse !	 So , honourable court ...
223  My men are mobilised .	 They are working on it .
225  Majesty !	 The priests \' patience has its limits .
227  We must find another solution .	 Balla , what do you think ?
228  Absolutely , what matters is the sacrifice .	 Never !
230  Majesty ...	 You are right ...
232  Wakhane !	 Bring that madman here forthwith .
233  Fetch him here , I want to meet him .	 Right !
235  Do not arrest him .	 Have him come .
237  That bothers you ?	 You , Kaya Maghan ... speak to a madman ?
239  Stop !	 I\' il teach you !
240  Little brats !	 Kerfa !
241  Calm down !	 Filthy urchins !
242  It\' s you who are crazy .	 Me , I have no name .
243  I even have no age .	 I am invisible and imperceptible !
244  A curse on you !	 And on your parents !
245  Malingering parents who abandon their children !	 Let go of me !
246  What do you want ?	 - Move , scum !
247  - Shut it and move !	 Get going !
248  Majesty !	 Here is the man whose tongue has agitated the entire town .
249  This is he .	 See ?
250  They\' d have my tongue , yet they bind my arms !	 Stupid !
251  On your knees before justice !	 No !
252  Never !	 Never !
254  Break his face and his legs !	 On your knees !
255  Let him go !	 Lay not a finger on him .
258  I\' m giving you the chance to repent .	 If you don\' t ,
261  Kaya Maghan , you are not like me .	 If you die ...
263  Sleep does not govern .	 - Leave us .
264  - What ?	 Leave you alone ?
265  This man is mad !	 I cannot .
266  I am responsible for your safety .	 I said leave us alone !
267  Untie him .	 Out .
268  All of you !	 So you are Kerfa the madman ...
271  Speak for you ?	 Out of the question !
277  Help me .	 I want to know my people better .
278  He wants to know his people better .	 Your people are there !
279  Outside !	 Today , they sing for you .
282  Me ?	 I am but the dream of others .
283  - The dream of others ?	 - Right !
284  Then Kerfa , be my dream too !	 Dream for my people !
285  - What\' s this ?	 - Here .
286  - What ?	 - Take the throne and dream .
287  Me ?	 Never !
288  Keep your throne !	 My dreams belong to me alone !
290  Leave my madness alone !	 Hands off !
291  Let me seek myself .	 Me , I seek myself !
292  He is already dead !	 Kaya Maghan is dead !
293  Kerfa !	 I will kill you !
294  I\' il wipe you out !	 Kill me ?
295  But I am already dead !	 Dead , but awake !
297  Believe me ...	 Nothing !
298  - Still here ...	 - Where were you ?
299  - At the palace , with Kaya Maghan .	 - Kaya Maghan ?
301  - Kill you ?	 Why ?
302  Because of me ?	 No , because of myself .
303  They wanted my dreams , my madness .	 I refused !
304  Not just anyone can be mad !	 You must earn it !
306  But it\' s too late .	 The wind is against him .
309  What he wants is ...	 I don\' t care what Kaya Maghan wants .
310  I want to live !	 Live !
311  Women !	 You can never fathom them !
314  Help me .	 Get up .
315  Listen ...	 Dry your tears .
316  He\' s coming .	 Who ?

318  Mamadi !	 He who acts more than he speaks .
319  We\' il see if he deserves his reputation .	 Come !

323  Nothing can stop me .	 Let\' s be gone from here .
324  Be gone from here ?	 You mean , flee from here !
325  Fleeing ...	 Always fleeing !
326  Some valiant soldier you are !	 Don\' t touch him !
327  He saved my life .	 I\' d have cut your head off !
328  Thanks to Sia , I spare you .	 You fool !
330  You can chop off as many heads as you like .	 Be off !
331  I\' il stay here and wait for death .	 Very well !
332  I\' ve understood .	 Come and hide , carnage is brewing .
333  Come .	 I\' m scared , Mamadi is risking his life .
334  Risk ?	 Risk is everywhere !
336  Come .	 Come !
337  Seize her !	 Kerfa !
338  Let go of me !	 Sia !

391  Incredible !	 Never does the vulture sing !
392  Never does the hyena dance !	 People of Koumbi , you are cursed !
393  I hate your songs and dances .	 They stink !

122  He\' s not going further .	 He pays .
124  And you ?	 Do you sometimes sleep with a prostitute ?
125  Why d\' you ask that ?	 You can say if you like .
126  - No , thats nothing for me .	 Why ?
127  I find it disgusting .	 Have you had a good day ?
130  Gryner was perplexed .	 And you ?

132  Quite expensive .	 Are you still reading ?
133  - No .	 Mum ?
134  Aren\' t you sleeping ?	 - Of course not .

138  She steals stuff .	 What ?
139  - Towels , cutlery ...	 But I have to keep quiet .
141  Disgraceful . !	 Your husband called me .
142  Very charming .	 We asked ourselves why we never saw each other .
143  - You never want to leave the house .	 Or you obstruct it .
145  He got me laughing after two sentences .	 You\' re lucky .
146  Such a cute guy .	 - Yea , he can definitely show himself .
147  You never talk about it .	 Maybe you find it normal , but ...

150  - Yes very nice .	 Hello .
151  D\' you want to drink something ?	 - Coke .
152  A coke please .	 Everything alright ?
153  - Yes .	 We saw each other again .
154  He was sitting in the same place .	 With his coffee and newspapers .
156  But it was very busy .	 So he suggested a different place .
157  We went to a hotel .	 - The bar of a hotel ?
158  No , to a room .	 How so , to a room ?
159  Yes , it happened automatically .	 He got what he wanted .
160  You went to bed with him ?	 Yes .
161  Thats not it !	 Thats not what I asked for !
164  It was decided .	 You\' re a normal average girl , Nathalie .
166  Sorry .	 I made a mistake .
167  Hurry up , we\' il be too late .	 Is there something ?
169  - I thik I\' m getting a flu .	 Are you angry ?
171  D\' you want an aspiririne ?	 - I already took one .
172  I\' il be back early .	 Good night .
173  D\' you want to drink something ?	 - A whiskey please .
175  - Sorry about this morning .	 Its ok .
176  You didn\' t say it .	 - What ?
178  I paid you .	 Come .
179  We\' il change clothes here .	 Lets think ...
180  It was a nice room .	 With red colours ..
182  I said nothing .	 He neither .
186  I felt his breathing .	 I think he was already very excited .
190  And then here .	 Shall I continue ?
192  I was thirsty .	 He came behind me .
193  He stood against my back .	 I started to move my thighs .
198  Then I went on top .	 I thrust my head backwards .
200  How long did it last ?	 I don\' t remember .
201  Quite long .	 When he came to orgasm , he supressed his scream .
202  I think he enjoyed it .	 And you ?
205  Did he notice it ?	 I pretend .
206  Thats my job .	 Now I must leave .
207  Hi Alice .	 - Hi madam .
208  Everything alright ?	 - Yes thank you .
209  Hi madam .	 Come along .
211  He was too late .	 He hadn\' t had lunch .
212  Did he order that ?	 He doesn\' t like Vouvray .
213  - I do .	 D\' you want some ?
214  Its my glass .	 - Thank you .
215  Tasty no ?	 Did it happen before ?
216  - Before and after .	 Sit down .
217  This time he undressed me .	 But not completely .
219  He came closer .	 Then he started licking them and bit them softly .
221  You think so ?	 - Yes .
224  I closed my legs .	 He liked me giving resistance .
225  He penetrated me .	 It lasted a long time .
226  And then he came to orgasm .	 This time without supressing a scream .
228  - Not immediately .	 He was tired and fell asleep .
230  I put some in the palm of his hands .	 This smell .
231  I stroked his cock with it .	 I put some on my stomach .
233  I thought he\' d like it .	 After that we smoked a cigarette .
235  He stopped me :	 " I don\' t want you to leave . "
237  About like that , yes .	 - Watch out .
238  He lies like anything .	 He isn\' t allowed to dump you immediately .
239  I don\' t expect that .	 Living in a hotel must be nice .
242  - I don\' t keep count .	 At what time do you start ?
243  - At seven .	 How many days a week ?
244  Normally four .	 More is possible too , if I want .
245  You smell good .	 What fragrance is that ?
246  D\' you like it ?	 I bought it today .
247  No , I\' m exhausted .	 She\' s there .
248  Shall we go ?	 See you later .
249  Everything alright ?	 - Yes , with you ?
252  Make- up Marilyn Monroe .	 For the lips she wanted help from me .
254  - How come ?	 &lt;i&gt;I had a problem .
261  &lt;i&gt;Hello ? &lt;/ i&gt;	 - I\' m still here .
262  &lt;i&gt;Am I bothering ?	 Are you free tonight ? &lt;/ i&gt;
263  - No .	 Not tonight .
264  &lt;i&gt;Pity .	 I\' m not working . &lt;/ i&gt;
265  - Come eat something .	 Come Catherine .
266  - Til later .	 I\' il call you .
267  Who was it ?	 Your mother ?
268  Big secret .	 Everything ok ?
270  How was he ?	 Calm ?
271  - Yes .	 He saw people he knew and waved to them .
272  What kind of people ?	 - A couple .
273  Was it a young woman ?	 And old one ?
274  - Like you .	 He found it annoying that they saw him .
275  I was wearing this skirt .	 My shoulderband was constantly sliding off .
277  I wasn\' t wearing any underwear .	 He noticed .
284  No .	 We walked through the street .
287  I went to sit over there .	 He stayed on his feet .
288  Motionless , without touching me .	 I took my dress off .
289  I was stark naked .	 We didn\' t care about people passing by .
290  I went up the stairs .	 He came after me .
292  There he took me .	 He fucked me .
293  It was hefty .	 And then ... something happened .
294  Nathalie also cummed .	 Nathalie ... you ?
295  With me it never happens whilst I work .	 But you did enjoy .
296  That\' s your fault .	 Do you still love him ?
297  I don\' t know .	 Please , madam .
298  - Thank you .	 Your mother called .
299  - I\' il call her back .	 Can you help a sec ?
301  Fourteen .	 And your job ?
302  - Dancer .	 Classical ballet .

307  It was a disaster .	 I couldn\' t .
309  See you miss .	 - Thank you .
310  Hi Alice .	 See you tomorrow .
311  - Hi madam .	 What are you doing here ?
312  I saw your sign .	 I hesitated but decided to come .
313  Was that wrong	 No .
314  I\' il get changed .	 Do you also get girls like me ?
315  - Sometimes .	 I couldn\' t , we know each other .
316  I shouldn\' t have come .	 - This is my job .
317  Did you see him again ?	 - Yes .
318  We can talk about it later .	 - We\' re here now already .
319  I don\' t want to speak about it here .	 Start already .
320  Ok .	 What happened today ?
324  - You can stop now .	 Are you shocked ?
325  You wanted all the details .	 Is that how he really talks ?
326  Vulgar words like that are nothing to him .	 - Not my fault .
327  And you gabble it off like that ...	 Its slutty in ...
328  Slutty ?	 Yes , and then ?
333  You could better leave .	 Go look for somebody else .
337  - My wife .	 Good evening .

1  AHyogensha- ATG Production	 MissTomioka ?
2  How\' s the script going ?	 The suicide part is difficult
3  The lovers \' suicidejourneywill be through a graveyard	 You found a location ?
4  In a ravine near Mt .	 Toribe in Kyoto
5  It\' s full ofstrange headstones	 I think it\' s stale
6  But it captures the space on stage , the nothingness	 There\' s something there
7  A sort offetishism ofspace	 Thevivid contrast between that and the bodies ofthe couple
9  You have to pull them in	 It should be realistic
11  Thewords could be random	 The essential image needs to be captured
13  - I\' il bewaiting .	 - Goodbye

15  DOUBLE SUlCIDE	 Avow a month ...
16  The 29th time	 Though I vowed that I\' d redeemyou
17  The 30thwill come nextyear	 Nextyear ? .
18  It\' s already December	 How longwill I have towait ? .
19  Well ...	 I don\' t know
23  No , Koharu	 Did I ever doubtyour love ? .
24  Even as I seeyou	 I worry about money to seeyou again
26  I fearyou won\' t love me any more	 The bodywas boughtwith money
29  But I can\' t live withoutyou	 Neither can I.
30  What shall we do ? .	 We can\' t run away together
31  I want to stay with you like this forever	 So do I.
34  You regret it ? .	 I want to die .
35  Can I diewith you ? .	 - Can I ? .
37  My Koharu !	 Good evening
39  As the weather changes every day	 My mood often changes
41  He\' s outside ...	 The man I hate
42  Koharu !	 It\' s nice to seeyou
43  You stopped seeing me , so I missed you	 You flatter me
45  Why bewith a poor man likeJihei ? .	 Soyou\' re spreading the false rumor
46  False ? .	 You know it\' s true
48  You fell in love with thewrong man	 There are many men in Osaka .
49  WhyJiehi ? .	 He married his cousin , and has two children
51  He\' s asking too much	 That\' s none ofyour concern
55  Her customertonight is a samurai	 Please go somewhere else tonight , Mr. Tahei
57  Who\' s afraid ? .	 I\' il buy the samurai togetherwith Koharu !
59  I thank him	 Let\' s chant a sutra jihei , the paper dealer
60  His clothes are made ofpaper	 His shop can\' t stand like paper
61  He\' s no better than waste paper	 Oh , merciful Buddha !
62  Speaking ofwaste , it\' s him	 What a costume !
63  A hat at night ? .	 Waste paper , why the costume ? .
64  Koharu	 I have no swords , but I\' m armed with money
66  It\' s stupid .	 Let\' s go to a better place
67  Ifwe seeJihei , let\' s kick him	 No one knows thevalue ofmoney around here
68  In thisworld , money is everything	 Remember it .
69  Let\' s go	 I\' m sorry , Samurai .
70  They offended you	 Wait , Samurai .
71  Excuse me	 I\' m glad you\' re not jihei in disguise
72  I had to make sure	 Then , Koharu , have a good timewith him
73  Please take care ofher	 You\' re still open in this cold ? .
74  I can\' t live if I stop vending	 That\' s true
75  What is it today ? .	 I just passed through the red light district
77  I mean I went there on business	 Koharu , the courtesan ? .
78  Koharu ofthe Kinokuniya	 I\' d like to be a woman in my next life
79  Fool	 Koharu , you\' ve lost weight
80  Deep insideyou love me	 I\' d like to elopewith you
81  Wherewould we go to die ? .	 Umeda ? .
82  Kitano ? .	 You examine me as if I were an animal
85  I came here alone and asked the mistress to call you	 Forwhat ? .
87  You\' re right , sir , but there\' s a reason	 Listen to me
88  Koharu is in lovewith a man named Jihei	 It\' s alwaysJihei
89  She accepts no one else	 But she\' s a courtesan
90  She has no right to choose	 Much less to love
91  It\' s bad for business	 It\' s the master\' s duty to stop her
92  So he chose good customers ...	 Likeyou , sir , for her
95  You frighten me	 It\' s too much
98  Ifyou diewith him his familywill hateyou	 Ifyou have parents , they\' il be sad
100  Although you\' re a strangerto me	 I can\' t justwatch you die
102  You\' re right .	 We promised to die together
104  And threeyears have passed	 I don\' t want anyone else to redeem me
105  But I\' m not free	 I have no right to choose my redeemer
107  Will it be today or tomorrow ? .	 But , thinking of my mother
108  I\' m her only child	 She\' s poor , living in a slum
109  If I die , she\' il starve	 I don\' t knowwhat to do
110  You said you\' d help me .	 Did you mean it ? .
111  Samurai don\' t lie	 You may laugh at me
112  But , honestly ...	 I don\' twant to die
114  Ifhe gives me up he\' il live and sowill I	 Koharu
115  That\' s human nature	 I understand
116  Let\' s get some fresh air	 Come over here
117  I failed !	 Driven by jealousy , he draws his sword
118  He\' s drunk .	 Forgive him !
119  No .	 Leave him to me
120  What happened ? .	 Here\' s a ruffian with a sword
121  He should be tied up like this	 Please forgive him !
122  Now , let\' s go to bed , Koharu	 Awild one .
123  It serves him right	 Leave it to me .
124  Gowith him	 Well , ifit isn\' tJihei !
125  I didn\' t seeyou around .	 You\' re here
126  I didn\' t knowyou were tied here	 You stole something ? .
128  Robber !	 Here\' sJihei , who stole and was caught
130  Thief ? .	 Tell mewhatJihei stole
132  I\' il remember each ofyourfaces !	 You\' il be sorry
133  Everyone laughs	 \' Catch him !
134  Beat him ! \'	 \' He\' s going thatway
135  \' Throw him in	 \' Don\' t let him go !! \'
136  jihei	 It\' syou , Brother Magoemon !
137  Your brother ? .	 What have I done !
138  I\' m ashamed ofmyself	 How could you cheat on me ?? ! .
139  I should stamp on you beforeTahei !	 I hateyou !

142  I did , as soon as I met hertoday	 I\' m ashamed
143  I let herfool me so easily !	 How miserable !
144  You\' re almost thirty , not a child	 You have a shop to run
145  You have two children to raise	 Yetyou\' re in lovewith a courtesan .
147  Listen !	 Osan , yourwife , is our cousin
148  Her mother is our aunt	 Herfather is old and stubborn
149  He saysyou fooled Osan	 He\' il take her back and shameyou
150  He\' s furious	 Her mother isworried
155  Too ridiculous to cry	 I\' m sorry , Brother
156  How I hate myself !	 I\' ve been taken in by this wench foryears
157  I left my family for her	 I even left my shop unattended
158  Brother , I realize I was wrong	 I\' il be through with her

161  Brother , get my twenty- nine promises from her	 And burn them !

172  She\' s fooled me for threeyears	 I\' il step on her
174  This is my goodbye	 Stop it, Jihei

235  Like the merchant	 - But ...
236  - Listen to me	 Gozaemon , my husband is very strict , asyou know
238  He loves Osan	 He said you\' d sell her off to redeem Koharu
239  Hewas furious	 Hewanted to get her before her clothes disappeared
240  He started to come	 I stopped him , saying , " Check the rumors
241  " beforeyou blameJihei "	 And I sent for Magoemon to come here
242  According to Magoemon	 " Jihei isn\' t the man he used to be
244  I didn\' t understand	 I came here and found out
245  - You\' re a lazyworm !	 - But ... jihei .
246  Yourfatherwas my brother	 Heworried aboutyou until he died
248  I can\' t forget it	 I can\' t even keep my promise to him
249  I understand	 The man redeeming Koharu isn\' t me
250  Brother	 RememberTahei ? .
253  We\' re through .	 Why should I redeem her ? .
254  Don\' t believe the false rumor	 Mother .
256  He\' s tellingyou the truth this time	 I\' il stand witness
257  You can\' t believe rumors	 Father is too hasty
259  Would they ? .	 Mother is hasty , too .

264  It\' s settled .	 I\' m so happy .
265  How can I thankyou ? .	 Itwas my fault , too
266  He\' il work hard from tomorrow on	 Osan is right
267  You can do anything ifyou try hard	 I\' vewritten it , Aunt
269  Becausewe loveyou all	 Becausewe\' re relatives
270  It\' s settled .	 Let\' s go , Magoemon
271  I\' il set my husband\' s mind at ease	 Hurry , Magoemon
272  Osan , thewind is cold	 Don\' t let the kids get sick .
273  Take care , Osan	 Our ancestorswill help you .
274  Namu amidabutsu	 Take care , Mother
275  Did Sangoro close the backdoors ? .	 Yes , he did
276  We must pay our bills tomorrow .	 Time flies !
278  Itwas hard to run the shop	 I\' m so glad
280  I needn\' t be jealous anymore	 What is it ? .
281  Areyou crying ? .	 Why ? .
282  Oh , no !	 Can\' tyou give her up after all ? .
283  You miss her so much ? .	 Why then did you promise ? .
284  Remember ? .	 It was in October twoyears ago
286  I thoughtwe could live like a couple	 Butyou still love her
287  It\' s cruel ofyou	 Ifyou miss her so much , cry hard
288  Letyourtears fall into the river	 Koharu will drink it
290  What have I done to deserve this ? .	 Pity the children
291  Finallywe\' re together again	 I don\' t know anything anymore !
292  Osan , you have the right to blame me	 Listen
293  Tears ofsadness and tears of joy flow the sameway	 They flow from the eyes
295  Listen to me	 She\' s a four- legged animal , not a human
296  Why should I miss her ? .	 She lied to me
298  She always said so	 Yet ten days afterwe parted she\' s alreadyyielded toTahei .
299  That tramp !	 Whywould I miss a courtesan like that ? .
300  Osan	 Why should I cry for her ? .
301  Then Koharu ...	 Tahei spread theword : jihei can\' t even redeem a courtesan
302  He said I was about to go bankrupt	 Wholesale clerks stare at me suspiciously
303  I live in shame	 Osan
304  I hate it !	 I hate it !
305  I can\' t tolerate it !	 jihei , what\' il I do ? .
306  That\' swhyyou\' re crying	 Then Koharu may die
307  Terrible !	 She\' il die
308  What\' il I do ? .	 She\' il die ? .
309  Osan	 You\' rewise , butyou don\' t know theworld
311  Shewon\' t die	 You\' rewrong
312  You\' rewrong this time	 I never meant to tell you this
313  But I can\' t let her die for me	 She didn\' twant to leaveyou
314  But she acted as if shewere foolingyou	 What areyou saying ? .
315  What did you do ? .	 You went to the pleasure quarters every night
318  You may think I shouldn\' t have done that	 But I\' m yourwife
320  Even ifyou don\' t love me	 I will do anything foryou
321  So Koharu ...	 She accepted my request
322  She answered she\' d giveyou up	 But it\' s not easy
324  Look	 She\' s decent , with a strong sense of duty
325  She wouldn\' t break her promise toyou	 Least ofall , to letTahei redeem her
326  Awoman in love is strong	 Shewon\' tyield easily
327  You see ? .	 She acted out ofregard for me
328  You don\' t understand	 You only talkabout love
329  What a man !	 At this rate , she\' il die
330  How can I let her die ? .	 We must save her life .
331  Save her !	 I rememberthe letter .
332  Brother read	 You wrote it ? .
333  I see	 Koharu may die , then
335  Go to her	 But what can I do ? .
337  I haven\' t got that much	 We can\' t save herwithout money
338  What\' il I do ? .	 What can I do ? .
339  It\' s no time for questions .	 We must raise it
340  Money ? .	 Eighty pieces of gold !
341  How did you get it ? .	 I didn\' t know
343  It\' s honest money	 I\' il make up for it later with Magoemon
344  We need seventy pieces more .	 What\' il I do ? .
345  Osan !	 You can get seventy from the pawnshop
346  Pawn my kimonos .	 I don\' t need them
347  You need yours to keep up a front	 Get the money and redeem her
348  Beat the hateful Tahei with the money	 But , Osan ...
350  Keep her somewhere ? .	 Here ? .
352  What\' il I do ? .	 Make her a nurse ? .
353  Or a cook ? .	 I should be punished
354  Byyou , ifnot by Heaven	 Forgive me , Osan .
355  Forgive me	 I\' m a hopelessly selfish fool
356  I madeyou raise the money for my courtesan	 Please forgive me , Osan
357  A husband shouldn\' t ask that	 It\' s a wife\' s duty .
359  My closet is already empty	 But I\' ve never regretted it
360  It\' s too late ifshe dies	 Go quick
361  Sangoro	 Take this bundle and accompanyyour master
362  IsJihei in ? .	 Father !
363  - Why ? .	 - Sit down jihei , my son- in- law
364  You\' re dressed up	 Wearing a sword , you look like a rich man
365  Going to the brothel ? .	 Every night ? .
366  You need nowife	 Osan , he doesn\' t need you
367  You mustn\' t go out in the cold	 I\' il get tea foryou
368  You must have heard from Mother	 She lectured my man today
371  Look at him	 As I thought , he\' s a liar

135  Christine	 Where in the world have you been hiding ?
136  Really , you were perfect	 I only wish I knew your secret
140  Who else , Meg ?	 Who ?
141  Father once spoke of an angel	 I used to dream he\' d appear
142  Now as I sing I can sense him	 And I know he\' s here
143  Here in this room he calls me softly	 Somewhere inside hiding
144  Somehow I know he\' s always with me	 He , the unseen genius
146  And it\' s not like you	 Angel of Music Guide and guardian
150  - It frightens me - Don\' t be frightened	 No .
151  No .	 You did very well , my dear .
152  He is pleased with you .	 - Vicomte .
153  - Vicomte .	 We\' ve made quiet a discovery with Miss Daae .
155  Thank you .	 It would appear they\' ve met before .
157  - Raoul .	 - " Or of riddles or frocks ? "
158  - Those picnics in the attic .	 - " Or of chocolates ? "
162  You sang like an angel tonight .	 Father said :
165  And now we go to supper .	 No , Raoul .
167  Raoul , no .	 You must change .
168  I\' il order my carriage , Little Lotte .	 No .
169  Raoul , wait !	 Insolent boy , this slave of fashion
170  Basking in your glory	 Ignorant fool , this brave young suitor
171  Sharing in my triumph	 Angel , I hear you Speak , I listen
172  Stay by my side Guide me	 Angel , my soul was weak Forgive me
173  Enter at last , master	 Flattering child , you shall know me
174  See why in shadow I hide	 Look at your face in the mirror
175  I am there inside !	 Angel of Music , guide and guardian
176  Grant to me your glory	 Angel of Music , hide no longer
177  Come to me , strange angel	 I am your Angel of Music
178  Come to me , Angel of Music	 Whose is that voice ?
180  Christine !	 Come to me , Angel of Music
181  In sleep he sang to me	 In dreams he came
182  That voice which calls to me	 And speaks my name
183  And do I dream again ?	 For now I find ...
185  Our strange duet	 My power over you ... ... grows stronger yet
191  Sing , my Angel of Music .	 Sing , my angel .
192  Sing for me !	 Sing , my angel .
193  Sing for me !	 I have brought you
195  Music , you have come here	 For one purpose , and one alone
197  For my music	 My music
198  Nighttime sharpens ... ... heightens each sensation	 Darkness stirs ... ... and wakes imagination
199  Silently the senses ... ... abandon their defenses	 Slowly , gently
200  Night unfurls its splendor	 Grasp it , sense it
201  Tremulous and tender	 Turn your face away
202  From the garish light of day	 Turn your thoughts away
203  From cold , unfeeling light	 And listen to the music of the night
205  Close your eyes	 Let your spirit start ... ... to soar
206  And you\' il live as you\' ve never lived before	 Softly , deftly
207  Music shall caress you	 Hear it , feel it
208  Secretly possess you	 Open up your mind
211  Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before	 Let your soul take you
212  Where you long to be	 Only then can you belong ... ... to me
213  Floating , falling	 Sweet intoxication
214  Touch me , trust me	 Savor each sensation
217  Help me make ...	 The music of the ...
218  ... night	 Christine ?
221  Oh , my .	 Those who speak of what they know
222  Find too late that prudent silence is wise	 Joseph Buquet , hold your tongue
224  Swirling mist upon a vast , glassy lake	 There were candles all around
227  Damn you !	 You little prying Pandora
228  You little demon !	 Is this what you wanted to see ?
229  Curse you !	 You little lying Delilah
230  You little viper Now you cannot ever be free	 Damn you !
231  Curse you !	 Stranger than you dreamt it
233  But secretly yearns for heaven ... ... secretly , secretly	 Christine
234  Fear can turn to love	 You\' il learn to see to find the man
235  Behind the monster , this	 Repulsive carcass who seems a beast
236  But secretly dreams of beauty ... secretly , secretly	 Oh , Christine
241  What a way to run a business	 Spare me these unending trials
242  Half your cast disappears but the crowd still cheers	 Opera !
245  But we have no cast	 Andre , have you seen the queue ?

259  And what is it that we\' re meant to have wrote ?	 Written .
263  - What is it ?	 - I have your letter
265  - You didn\' t send it ?	 - Of course not
269  Far too many notes for my taste	 And most of them about Christine

314  Sing , prima donna	 Once more
316  His Lordship , sure would die of shock	 His Lordship is a laughingstock

344  An accident .	 Why have you brought me here ?
350  - And in this labyrinth	 Where night is blind
353  To a world where the daylight dissolves into darkness	 Darkness

582  - Mort Rainey ?	 - Oh , hi , Dave .
583  I didn\' t hear you .	 Come on up .
584  Glad you\' re here .	 I could use the break .
585  Working lunch .	 I\' m on a roll .
586  Yeah .	 Both you and I know what you did .
590  Sure .	 No problem .
592  And this one ... ... is very good .	 This one\' s perfect .

1  You and Greim must go as quickly as possible .	 Fly to D\xc3\xb6nitz .
3  Thank you for this proof of loyalty .	 But Himmler must die .
4  He committed treason .	 He\' s no longer privvy to my plans .
8  Kesselring in the south .	 We\' il surround the enemy and crush them .
13  Himmler is a traitor .	 He won\' t escape punishment .
15  My family ...	 If the Russians ...
16  I must leave .	 You did nothing wrong .
18  We\' il talk about it later .	 Gruppenf\xc3\xbchrer Fegelein cannot be found .
20  Keep searching .	 I need to talk to him .
21  Immediately .	 If he left just like that , that\' s desertion .
22  Treason .	 Bring me Fegelein .
23  Fegelein .	 Fegelein .
25  - No .	 Thank you .
26  Brigitte is hungry too .	 Ilse , you should eat something as well .
27  Thank you .	 - There you go .
28  Thank you .	 What is it ?
29  - Gruppenf\xc3\xbchrer , you\' re under arrest .	 What ?
30  - You\' re suspected of desertion .	 Get dressed .
31  You\' il come with us .	 Search the room .
32  Let go of me .	 You can\' t give me orders .
34  He wanted to flee .	 What does it matter ?
35  Everything\' s over .	 Think of my poor sister .
36  She\' s pregnant by Hermann .	 He collaborated with Himmler .
37  He\' s a traitor .	 There\' s no mercy for traitors .
38  No compassion for them .	 He\' il be court- martialled and executed .
39  What\' s the point of that ?	 It is my wish .
40  You\' re the F\xc3\xbchrer .	 Speak .
41  The Russians are advancing more and more .	 There are no more reserves .
44  Lustgarten .	 South :
45  Potsdammer Platz .	 West :
47  - At most , two days .	 Including the government area ?
48  - Yes .	 As a soldier , I suggest we flee Berlin .
50  That\' s what young people are for .	 What you suggest is insane .
51  Ridiculous .	 Think of the thousands of wounded .
56  Wenck\' s an excellent fellow .	 Send a telegram to Keitel :
57  Immediately report to me the following :	 1 .
58  Where are Wenck\' s vanguard located ?	 2 .
59  When will they attack again ?	 3 .
60  Where is the 9th army ?	 4 .
61  Where will the 9th make a breakthrough ?	 You\' il see , gentlemen .
62  I\' il be right .	 Wenck will come .
66  Has everybody gone mad ?	 Do you think the F\xc3\xbchrer doesn\' t know ?
67  He\' il never surrender .	 And neither will we .
68  I\' ve been through that once .	 Never again .
69  Come along .	 I have to go .
70  Stop right there .	 Heil Hitler .
71  Excuse me .	 I fell asleep .
72  Did you get some rest , my child ?	 In shorthand .
75  The shooting .	 - Please sit down .
77  What is it , Herr Minister ?	 Imagine this .
78  The F\xc3\xbchrer wants me to leave Berlin .	 He ordered it .
81  I\' m typing the F\xc3\xbchrer\' s will .	 Good .
82  I understand .	 Some other time .
86  Then there\' s nothing to stop us .	 I\' m asking you now :
89  Then I declare you man and wife .	 Two men here .
90  Everything will be alright .	 You must go to the F\xc3\xbchrer right away .
91  - Now ?	 How long can we hold out ?
92  - Twenty hours , no more .	 The Russians are close .
95  All the best .	 Thank you .
96  It wasn\' t just for Germany .	 A message from Keitel .
97  1 .	 Wenck\' s vanguard are stuck south of Schwielowsee .
98  2 .	 The 12th army can\' t continue the attack on Berlin .
99  3 .	 The 9th army is completely surrounded .
101  Never .	 I forbid you , and the other commanders , to surrender .
102  Listen , G\xc3\xbcnsche .	 My wife and I are going to commit suicide .
106  - Erich , I need 200 litres of petrol .	 Are you mad ?
107  Where should I find them ?	 From the parked vehicles .
108  What\' s all that petrol for ?	 - I can\' t say .
109  Come , please .	 The F\xc3\xbchrer wants to see us .
111  I\' il die soon anyway .	 Excuse me .
112  Over here , Herr Professor .	 One moment , please .
113  Excuse me .	 I\' m sorry to interrupt your important work .
115  Come along .	 Join the gang .
116  Come .	 Have a drink .
118  That\' s better .	 Yes , the situation is pretty shitty .
119  Can we sit down ?	 - Please do , Fr\xc3\xa4ulein ...
120  Frau ...	 - That\' s Frau Hitler .
121  It\' s alright .	 A pity we can\' t go outside anymore .
123  - Yes .	 Control .
124  Take cover .	 What are you doing here ?
126  Sit down .	 Sit .
127  Drink .	 Let me introduce Frau Hitler .
128  So young and so many decorations .	 You must be proud .
129  Excuse me .	 I\' m not used to drinking anymore .
133  Tornow , you too .	 Come Blondi .
136  He only talks about dogs and vegetarian food now .	 I hate Blondi .
142  I want you to enjoy it .	 What a surprise .
144  Please , try to get out of here .	 Promise me .
145  Thank you .	 That was very good , Fr\xc3\xa4ulein Manziarly .
146  The time has come .	 It\' s finished .
147  The F\xc3\xbchrer wants to say goodbye .	 Come with me .
149  Salute my beautiful Bavaria .	 Children , what are you doing here ?
151  - Only breakfast .	 Stay here , I\' il get something to eat .
156  Please .	 Mein F\xc3\xbchrer , Frau Goebbels is here .
157  What is it ?	 Mein F\xc3\xbchrer , I beg you :
158  Leave Berlin .	 Don\' t leave us F\xc3\xbchrer .
160  Get up .	 Come .
161  Come .	 Aunt Traudl , I like it when it thunders .
162  Why ?	 - Nothing can happen to us here .
163  Can it ?	 - No .
164  Gotcha .	 Reichsleiter , it\' s over .
165  The F\xc3\xbchrer is dead .	 There\' s daddy .
166  Are you crazy ?	 For that damned petrol of yours ...
167  Erich , shut up .	 Stand back .
168  Come on , continue .	 Continue .
169  No , don\' t .	 Let grandpa go .
170  Order .	 Order .
171  We must have order .	 Order has to return .
172  This way .	 We know the way .
173  You can trust us .	 Hurry .
176  - Or not .	 What news do you have , General ?
179  Given the situation , you have no other choice .	 Surrender ?
180  Never .	 That\' s shameful .
183  This is crazy .	 We have to start negotiations .
184  I repeat , gentlemen :	 I do not surrender .
185  Send a message to Marshal Zhukov .	 - Zhukov ?
186  What\' s happening ?	 - We\' re surrendering .
187  Then I must kill you .	 The F\xc3\xbchrer forbids any surrender .
188  How long does it work ?	 - Around four hours .
190  A sip for everybody .	 Who wants to go first ?
191  Heide , you\' re always so brave ?	 Have another sip .
192  See ?	 That wasn\' t so bad .
193  Well done .	 Helmut .
195  Well done .	 Helga .
196  I don\' t want to .	 What\' s that ?
197  Do you want to get sick ?	 - Please , mama .
198  I don\' t want to drink it .	 Don\' t cry , baby .
199  That doesn\' t help .	 You have to drink the medicine .
200  Helga .	 Come on , open your mouth .
205  - So what ?	 I want to get away .
206  How do we get through the lines ?	 Doesn\' t matter .
207  I\' m not staying another minute .	 We\' il die .
209  All the best .	 Come , let\' s go .
213  A glass of water , please .	 I don\' t need you anymore .
214  The game\' s over .	 It\' s time .
216  Alright , then .	 Go .
217  You did a lot .	 Thank you .
218  Sch\xc3\xa4dle , hurry .	 Come on .
219  - I\' m not going anywhere anymore .	 Come along .
220  Are you alright ?	 - Keep going .
223  Take cover , M\xc3\xbciler .	 Who\' s that ?
224  A German .	 Herr Hewel ?
225  Thank God , you\' re alive .	 Where are the others ?
226  I don\' t know , Frau Junge .	 Somewhere .
227  Maybe .	 Most people from my group must be dead .
229  Eat something first .	 There\' s always enough time to die .
230  You stay with the women .	 Come along .
232  Maybe you can get through .	 You could try .
233  I\' m not taking another step .	 Think about it .

245  The Russians are evacuating the square .	 - So ?
246  No opposition .	 No shooting .
247  Then they\' il be here within the hour .	 What shall we do ?
248  We can\' t surrender .	 - What exactly do you mean ?
251  We\' re SS officers .	 We can\' t survive the F\xc3\xbchrer .
252  Who agrees with me ?	 Come and sit down with me ?
253  - Please .	 Why do you want to continue living ?
254  - And you ?	 Why do you want to die ?
255  See this ?	 The F\xc3\xbchrer gave it to me personally .
256  As a last decoration ?	 - Maybe .
257  A goodbye present from Hitler .	 I had to promise him something .
261  There they are .	 Don\' t shoot , comrades .
262  We surrendered .	 The war is over .
263  It\' s over .	 Complete surrender took place on 7 May 1945 .

156  Do I have any choice ?	 He kills without a thought
157  He murders all that\' s good	 I know I can\' t refuse
158  And yet , I wish I could	 Oh , God , if I agree
161  Seal my fate tonight	 I hate to have to cut the fun short

166  Serve the meal and serve the maid	 Serve the meal and serve the maid
175  Master ?	 Passarino
176  Go away , for the trap is set	 And waits for its prey
178  Silent	 I have brought you ... ... that our passions may fuse and merge
180  Now you are here with me	 No second thoughts
181  You\' ve decided	 Decided
182  Past the point of no return	 No backward glances
184  No use resisting	 Abandon thought
185  And let the dream descend	 What raging fire shall flood the soul ?
186  What rich desire unlocks its door ?	 What sweet seduction lies before us ?
187  Past the point of no return	 The final threshold
188  What warm , unspoken secrets	 Will we learn ?
190  Silence	 I have come here
192  Now I am here with you	 No second thoughts
193  I\' ve decided	 Decided
194  Past the point of no return	 No going back now
196  One final question	 How long should we two wait
197  Before we\' re one ?	 When will the blood begin to race ?
198  The sleeping bud burst into bloom ?	 When will the flames at last
199  Consume us ?	 Past the point of no return
200  The final threshold	 The bridge is crossed
201  So stand and watch it burn	 We\' ve passed the point of no

485  Damn !	 No one can imagine what it\' s like .
487  Attack , before we\' re all slaughtered .	 Prepare bayonets !
488  All that was nothing compared to what followed .	 For France !
490  We were wiped out !	 That Lavrouye bastard !
491  He kept the paper to himself .	 Stretcher- bearers !
492  What paper ?	 That\' s all he said .
495  Something stinks here .	 Something stinks ?
496  Lavrouye stinks .	 This food doesn\' t .
497  Dig in before it gets cold .	 It\' s cold !
499  False hope will only make you suffer .	 They\' re not false !
500  You\' il taste my cake ?	 I don\' t know if I should .
501  With a bit of fresh cream .	 If you insist ...
503  Let\' s all get some sleep .	 Slow down !
505  Hey , Postman !	 I\' il drop you off at the next letterbox .
506  And my bike ?	 Leave it to me .
507  I fought in the war !	 I don\' t have a desk job .
508  It\' s not my fault .	 I\' m asthmatic !
509  An asthmatic who rides a bike !	 - By the sea .
513  He wouldn\' t write such trivialities .	 Don\' t you agree ?
518  The one with the boots wasn\' t Bastoche .	 It was Gordes !
520  Desrochelles .	 I\' d met some stretcher- bearers who\' d just passed them .
521  Are you from Bingo ?	 Might be .
523  - Desrochelles .	 - They\' re off to first- aid .
524  - With German boots !	 Long Live Anarchy !
525  Anarchy .	 What\' s happened , Matti ?
526  What did I say ?	 Open up !
527  Be reasonable .	 - What did you do ?
528  - Nothing .	 You\' ve known he\' s dead for three years .
529  I call that stubbornness .	 No , I call that hope .
530  Poux has just killed it .	 If I can do anything ...
531  You can .	 Take me to Bingo Cr\xc3\xa9puscule .
533  It was there !	 Right there !
536  - Not a pretty sight .	 - No doubt !
537  The youngest was only a boy .	 Was he wearing a glove ?
539  I can\' t remember seeing a glove .	 Athos !
541  It\' s the crypt !	 There was a chapel between the two trenches .
542  It was in ruins .	 Incredible .
545  Maybe he took it off to carve ?	 I couldn\' t say .
546  But I don\' t think so .	 What sort of red was it ?
547  Bright red ?	 A flashy red .
548  With white dots .	 Looked like maggots on an apple !
554  Then ... your side attacked .	 They killed my brother .
556  I\' m sorry .	 Time heals all .
558  Seems I haven\' t killed it .	 Pardon ?
559  Hope !	 What now ?
560  Tina Lombardi .	 She\' s going to the guillotine !
565  I\' d be too scared .	 I\' m not scared .
566  And I regret nothing .	 Except my hair .
569  Why not Poincar\xc3\xa9 ?	 He refused them a pardon .
570  You don\' t know ?	 He did pardon them .
571  All five !	 It\' s just a leave .
573  Because dirty dogs play dirty .	 That\' s all .
574  Trust me on this .	 I took care of him !
578  He was a big man .	 Head wound , German boots ...
580  I\' m even sure of it .	 A big man , head wound ...
584  I took care of him , too !	 It was an obsession .
585  Kill all those who hurt my man .	 Your Angel left you this .
586  " Vengeance is pointless .	 Try to be happy ,
589  Biscuit ?	 He was no athlete .
591  He didn\' t make friends easily .	 He lived alone with his mother .
592  I must go .	 I\' m boarding in an hour for Venezuela .
593  Good luck , C\xc3\xa9lestin !	 To you too !

625  Don\' t worry .	 I had the chance to do away with you ...
626  I let it go .	 We knew you were a thief .
627  But a pyromaniac ?	 I couldn\' t kill you .
629  You know what I want to hear .	 Is he alive ?
632  - Gaignard !	 - You think we\' re at the whorehouse ?
633  - Bouquet !	 - What now ?
634  Notre Dame ?	 Then the pimp tried to surrender .
638  For France !	 Charge !
640  A few hours later , a voice woke me .	 My God !
641  Bastoche is dead !	 We can\' t leave him here .
642  We\' il come back .	 He\' s not going anywhere .
643  Bastoche is dead .	 Look , this one\' s still moving .
644  It\' s the Cornflower .	 He\' s a goner as well .
646  Bastoche is dead !	 We\' re all going to die .
649  Let\' s go look over there .	 Look here !
650  Damn it !	 It\' s not the Cornflower .
651  What\' s he doing in there ?	 Where\' s the Dordogne farmer ?
652  - I\' m cold .	 - Don\' t worry .
655  I felt the heat on my back .	 And he was delirious .
656  Spoke of a heart beating in his hand .	 Hey , Corporal !
659  Have it your way !	 I arrived just before the explosion .
661  Will he make it ?	 His hip wound isn\' t too bad .
663  I don\' t want to know anything else .	 But good luck anyway !
664  Block the pulley !	 Please !
668  Goodbye .	 How strange .

448  - Mr. Walsh ?	 - Mr. Walsh ?
452  You there !	 See what happens when you forget your place .
454  - A zebra !	 Which is what you are .
456  A racehorse .	 You\' re nothing of the kind .
458  You will never be a racehorse .	 A zebra ?
459  I thought I was a racehorse .	 Why didn\' t anyone tell me ?
461  - I didn\' t .	 And don\' t change the subject .
463  Just don\' t .	 Why not ?
466  Don\' t do it .	 Well , well , well .
468  Jersey flashback .	 Hey , we made it , man !
469  Nice !	 That sure beats flying .
473  Afternoon , Woodzie .	 - What brings you out here ?
474  - I got a hunch about your zebra .	 Look at this .
477  Your zebra .	 Look , that zebra really wants to race .
478  I can see it .	 You just need to train him .
480  I don\' t .	 I do .
482  Come on , Nolan .	 No .
483  That\' s final .	 Too poor to paint , too proud to whitewash .
484  He\' s not gonna let Stripes race .	 That\' s not cool .
485  Let\' s go talk to Tucker .	 - Guess who .
486  - Hey , Buzz and Scuzz !	 How you been , fellas ?
488  Yeah , yeah .	 Listen , listen .

494  We\' il cheer you up .	 Check this one out .
495  Get off me , you stupid flies !	 Get off !
497  - Told you we should\' ve rapped .	 - Stripes .
498  Walking away isn\' t gonna solve anything .	 Who cares .
500  - The chief will never go for it .	 Of course he will .
501  Just like somebody else I know .	 He just needs a little push .
502  I\' m going to bed .	 Channing ?
503  - Yeah ?	 - Why don\' t you come on out here .
504  Come on .	 This is gonna be a hard one , honey .
506  Dad .	 No !
507  It\' s not Stripes \' fault .	 He\' s not the problem .
509  I ...	 I know him better than anyone ever could .
510  I love him .	 What do you think the alternative is ?
511  I don\' t ride him .	 Ever , ever again .
512  That\' s right , honey .	 Franny ?
513  Hey .	 Hey .
514  How did you know ?	 If you build it , they will come .
515  Well , it\' s showtime , kid .	 You ready to start training ?

534  Careful , Chan .	 Careful .
535  It\' s all right .	 Stop .
536  Walk him away .	 Now , just walk him away from the gate .
537  The gate\' s always trouble .	 They should know .
538  He needs a break .	 He needs a break .
543  - What ?	 - I don\' t belong in the gate !
545  Racing is for anyone .	 Anyone with a fire in their heart .
546  What do you know , you little nobody ?	 You never raced .
547  They\' re all the same .	 Tucker doesn\' t understand .
549  What\' s he ever done ?	 Let me tell you something .
552  Hit the hay !	 Come here .
557  - And that\' s it ?	 No .
558  Look closer .	 - That\' s Sir Trenton .
559  - And who else ?	 - Tucker .
560  - That\' s right , Tucker .	 He trained Sir Trenton .
566  I can relate .	 It\' s just ...
567  I\' m not really a racehorse .	 I\' m a ...
568  - I\' m a zebra .	 - So what ?
570  Now listen to me , kid .	 You\' re right .
572  But the gate !	 I freeze up .
573  It keeps me from running .	 I don\' t know what it is .
575  It\' s perfectly normal .	 But they get over it .
576  You will too .	 You just keep running , okay ?
578  Attaboy !	 Yeah , boy !
579  Did you see that ?	 You see that ?
580  Good job , Chan !	 There it is !
581  That\' s what I\' m talking about !	 Good job , Chan !
582  Walk him out .	 We might actually have a chance .
584  - And that\' s the gate .	 - No problem .
586  Relax , Nolan .	 If anyone can do it , you can .
587  I\' m counting on it .	 It\' s gonna sound like a carnival .
588  You won\' t know which way to look .	 Look straight ahead .
590  You gotta let all this ...	 This out of your mind .
591  All that\' s gotta fall away .	 That\' s right .
592  That\' s right .	 Because I want your world to be silent .
594  Easy does it .	 Come on , buddy .
595  - That\' s a good boy .	 - Good boy .
596  - Good boy .	 - That\' s it .

669  Oh , yeah !	 No , you right .
670  You are right .	 Let us go and kick some horse flank .
672  Quiet !	 Thank you .
677  Knock it off , Reggie .	 Now , listen up .
678  Here\' s what we\' re gonna do .	 Listen , boy .
684  We\' il never get her out .	 Oh , yes , we will .
685  We just need a diversion .	 I got your diversion right here .
686  Out of my way .	 Goose !

464  Oh , yeah .	 Fletcher ?

481  Please , please , no .	 Who are you , Alan ?
482  No !	 No !
483  No !	 Why did you do that ?
484  Mine !	 You\' re still here .
485  Alan , this thing is junked .	 The implant itself is severed .
487  OK .	 Well , where is it ?
488  My implant .	 What ?
490  Everybody else has .	 I deserved that one .
497  I need it right now .	 Yeah ?
498  Well , that\' s impossible .	 Oh , no , it\' s possible .
500  Yeah .	 I performed that ... and the woman never recovered , Alan .
507  But you understand , you can never cut again .	 Yeah .
511  You know exactly which scene you\' re going to ?	 I sure do .
512  You have five minutes .	 Anything longer than that is just too risky .
513  OK .	 Christie .
514  I remember her .	 It\' s me .
515  Alan .	 Almost there .
516  There we are .	 Come and get me .

529  Do you have any idea how close you came ?	 I saw him .
530  I tried to help .	 I told him to turn around .
531  He wouldn\' t listen .	 He fell , but ... he was breathing .
532  It wasn\' t blood .	 It was paint .
533  Now I remember .	 Thank you .
534  Looking for this ?	 The implant\' s history .
536  Do you ?	 He died of a coronary complication .
538  I guess no one will .	 I bet he still keeps good notes .
539  Don\' t you , Alan ?	 All of it ?
540  All of it .	 It was a terrible accident .
543  You will ... waive your fee ?	 Of course .
545  Accidents will happen .	 Perhaps some things are best forgotten .
546  Perhaps .	 God , Isabel , you scared me .
547  Isabel , honey , what\' s the matter ?	 Isabel .
548  Isabel , what ...	 What\' s wrong , honey ?
549  Isabel .	 A friend ?
550  Yeah .	 Something like that .

152  Do you believe in fate , Neo ?	 No .
155  You know something .	 What you know , you can\' t explain .
156  But you feel it .	 You felt it your entire life .
159  Do you know what I\' m talking about ?	 The Matrix ?
161  It is all around us .	 Even now , in this very room .
164  What truth ?	 That you are a slave .
170  Follow me .	 Apoc , are we on- line ?
171  Almost .	 Time is always against us .
172  Please take a seat there .	 You did all this ?
177  This can\' t be .	 Be what ?
178  Be real ?	 Going into replication .
179  Still nothing .	 It\' s cold .
180  It\' s cold !	 Tank , we\' il need a signal soon .

182  Targeting almost there .	 He\' s going into arrest .
183  Lock .	 I got him !
185  We\' ve done it , Trinity .	 We found him .
187  I know it .	 Am I dead ?
188  Far from it .	 He still needs a lot of work .
189  What are you doing ?	 Your muscles atrophied .
190  We\' re rebuilding them .	 Why do my eyes hurt ?
191  You\' ve never used them before .	 Rest , Neo .
192  The answers are coming .	 Morpheus , what\' s happened to me ?
196  Come with me .	 See for yourself .
197  This is my ship .	 The Nebuchadnezzar .
198  It\' s a hovercraft .	 This is the main deck .
201  . . . and Cypher .	 The ones you don\' t know :
203  You wanted to know what the Matrix is ?	 Trinity .
204  Try to relax .	 This will feel a little weird .
207  Is it really so hard to believe ?	 Your clothes are different .
208  The plugs in your body are gone .	 Your hair has changed .
210  This isn\' t real ?	 What is " real " ?
225  What is the Matrix ?	 Control .
227  No .	 I don\' t believe it .
229  I just said it would be the truth .	 Stop !
230  Let me out !	 Let me out !
231  I want out !	 - Easy , Neo .
232  Easy .	 - Get this thing out of me .
233  Get this thing out of me !	 Don\' t touch me !
234  Stay away from me !	 I don\' t believe it .
235  I don\' t believe it .	 I don\' t believe it .
236  - He\' s gonna pop .	 - Breathe , Neo .
237  Just breathe .	 I can\' t go back , can l ?
239  I owe you an apology .	 We have a rule .
246  Get some rest .	 You\' re going to need it .
247  For what ?	 Your training .
248  Morning .	 Did you sleep ?
249  You will tonight .	 I guarantee it .
250  I\' m Tank .	 I\' il be your operator .
251  - You don\' t have any -- - Holes ?	 Nope .
253  Genuine child of Zion .	 - Zion ?
255  The last human city .	 The only place we have left .
257  You live long enough , you might see it .	 Goddamn !
261  That\' s major boring shit .	 Let\' s do something more fun .
262  How about . . .	 . . . combat training ?
263  " Jujitsu " ?	 I\' m going to learn jujitsu ?
265  How about some more ?	 Hell , yes .
266  Hell , yeah .	 How is he ?
267  Ten hours straight .	 He\' s a machine .
268  I know kung fu .	 Show me .
273  Good !	 Adaptation .
275  Morpheus is fighting Neo .	 How did I beat you ?
277  You think you\' re breathing air ?	 Again !
279  What are you waiting for ?	 You\' re faster than this .
280  Don\' t think you are .	 Know you are .
281  Come on !	 Stop trying to hit me , and hit me !
284  You have to walk through it .	 Tank , load the jump program .
286  Free your mind .	 Okey- dokey .
287  Free my mind .	 What if he makes it ?
288  - No one\' s ever made their first jump .	 - I know .
289  - But what if he does ?	 - He won\' t .
290  Come on .	 All right .
291  No problem .	 Free my mind .
292  Free my mind .	 No problem .
293  Right .	 What does that mean ?
294  It doesn\' t mean anything .	 Everybody falls the first time .
295  Right , Trin ?	 - I thought it wasn\' t real .
300  The Matrix is a system , Neo .	 That system is our enemy .
305  Freeze it .	 This isn\' t the Matrix ?
307  - What are they ?	 - Sentient programs .
311  Someone ?	 I won\' t lie to you , Neo .
313  Why ?	 I\' ve seen an agent punch through a concrete wall .
316  That I can dodge bullets ?	 No , Neo .
318  Did Zion send the warning ?	 No , another ship .
319  Shit .	 Squiddy\' s sweeping in quick .
320  Squiddy ?	 A sentinel .
321  A killing machine designed for one thing .	 Search and destroy .
322  Set her down there .	 How are we doing , Tank ?

326  Their old service and waste systems .	 Sewers .
328  Quiet .	 You scared the bejesus out of me .
329  - Sorry .	 - It\' s okay .
330  Is that . . . ?	 The Matrix ?
333  You get used to it .	 I don\' t even see the code .
338  Dozer makes it .	 It\' s good for two things :
339  Degreasing engines and killing brain cells .	 So can I ask you something ?
340  Did he tell you why he did it ?	 Why you\' re here ?
341  Jesus !	 What a mind job .
344  Run .	 You run your ass off .
345  Thanks for the drink .	 Sweet dreams .
346  Do we have a deal , Mr. Reagan ?	 You know . . .
349  Then we have a deal .	 I don\' t want to remember nothing .
350  Nothing .	 You understand ?
351  And I want to be rich .	 You know , someone important .
352  Like an actor .	 Whatever you want , Mr. Reagan .
354  Access codes to the Zion mainframe .	 No .
356  Morpheus .	 Here you go , buddy .
358  Or a bowl of snot .	 You know what it reminds me of ?
359  Tastee Wheat .	 Did you ever eat Tastee Wheat ?
363  That makes you wonder .	 Take chicken , for example .
367  You know , I wrote that program .	 Here it comes .
368  - What did you think of her ?	 - Of who ?
369  The woman in the red dress .	 I designed her .
373  I\' m taking Neo to see her .	 See who ?
375  Sit back and enjoy your flight .	 We\' re in .
377  - God !	 - What ?
378  I used to eat there .	 Really good noodles .
379  I have these memories from my life .	 None of them happened .

382  Did you go to her ?	 Yes .
383  What did she tell you ?	 She told me . . . .
384  What ?	 We\' re here .
386  Yes .	 She\' s very old .
387  She\' s been with us since the beginning .	 The beginning ?
388  Of the Resistance .	 And she knows what ?
389  Everything ?	 She would say she knows enough .
392  She helped you ?	 What did she tell you ?
394  You have to walk through it .	 Hello , Neo .
395  You\' re right on time .	 Make yourself at home , Morpheus .
396  Neo , come with me .	 These are the other Potentials .
397  You can wait here .	 Do not try and bend the spoon .
398  That\' s impossible .	 Instead , only try to realize the truth .
399  What truth ?	 There is no spoon .
401  It is only yourself .	 The Oracle will you see now .
402  I know you\' re Neo .	 Be right with you .
403  You\' re the Oracle ?	 Bingo .
404  Not quite what you were expecting , right ?	 Almost done .
406  And don\' t worry about the vase .	 What vase ?
407  That vase .	 I\' m sorry .
411  Who ?	 Not too bright , though .
413  Do you think you are the One ?	 I don\' t know .
414  You know what that means ?	 It\' s Latin .
419  Open your mouth .	 Say , " Ah . "
421  Then you say :	 But what ?
424  What ?	 Your next life , maybe .
425  Who knows ?	 That\' s the way these things go .
426  What\' s funny ?	 Morpheus .
427  He almost had me convinced .	 I know .
428  Poor Morpheus .	 Without him , we\' re lost .
434  Which one will be up to you .	 I\' m sorry , kiddo .
435  I really am .	 You have a good soul .
438  You\' re in control of your own life .	 Remember ?
439  Here . . .	 . . . take a cookie .

454  Operator .	 Find a structural drawing of this building .
455  Find it fast .	 - Got it !
456  - I need the main wet- wall .	 Eighth floor .
457  They\' re on the eighth floor .	 Switch , straight ahead .
458  I hope the Oracle gave you some good news .	 Now left .
459  That\' s it .	 Good .
460  Where are they ?	 They\' re in the walls .
461  In the walls !	 It\' s an agent !
462  You must get Neo out !	 He\' s all that matters !

474  Nearest exit , Franklin and Erie .	 An old TV repair shop .
475  Right .	 - Operator .
476  - Tank , it\' s me .	 Is Morpheus alive ?
477  Is Morpheus alive , Tank ?	 Yes .
478  They\' re moving him .	 I don \' t know where .
479  He\' s alive .	 We need an exit .
480  You\' re not far from Cypher .	 - Cypher ?
481  - I know .	 - I sent him to Franklin and Erie .
482  - Got it .	 Got him .
483  Where are they ?	 Making the call .
484  Good .	 You first .
485  Shit !	 I don\' t know .
486  It just went dead .	 Hello , Trinity .
487  Cypher ?	 Where\' s Tank ?
491  You killed them .	 - What ?
492  - Oh , God .	 I\' m tired , Trinity .
497  He lied to us , Trinity .	 He tricked us !
499  He set us free .	 " Free . "
502  The Matrix isn\' t real .	 I disagree , Trinity .
505  But you\' re out .	 - You can \' t go back .
506  - That\' s what you think .	 They\' il reinsert my body .
509  Not like this .	 Not like this .
510  Too late .	 Goddamn you , Cypher !
511  Don\' t hate me , Trinity .	 I\' m just a messenger .
515  Come on .	 All I want is a little yes or no .
518  You first .	 You\' re hurt .
519  I\' il be all right .	 Dozer ?
523  No one would accept the program .	 Entire crops were lost .
527  Evolution , Morpheus .	 Evolution .
528  Like the dinosaur .	 Look out that window .
529  You had your time .	 The future is our world , Morpheus .
530  The future is our time .	 There could be a problem .
532  It\' s like hacking a computer .	 All it takes is time .
533  How much time ?	 Depends on the mind .
538  There is .	 We pull the plug .
539  You\' re going to kill him ?	 Kill Morpheus ?
542  In either case --	 We have no choice .
543  Continue as planned .	 Deploy the sentinels .
544  Immediately .	 Morpheus , you were more than a leader to us .
545  You were a father .	 We\' il miss you always .
546  Stop !	 I don\' t believe this is happening .
547  - Neo , this has to be done .	 - Does it ?
548  I don\' t know .	 This can\' t be just coincidence .
549  What ?	 The Oracle .
551  What choice ?	 What are you doing ?
552  I\' m going in .	 No , you\' re not .
558  It can\' t be true .	 Why ?
559  This is loco .	 They\' ve got Morpheus in a military- controlled building .
563  I understand that now .	 That\' s why I have to go .
564  Why ?	 Because I believe in something .
565  What ?	 I believe I can bring him back .
566  - What are you doing ?	 - Going with you .
567  No , you\' re not .	 " No " ?
575  A virus .	 Human beings are a disease .
576  A cancer of this planet .	 You are a plague .
578  Besides a miracle .	 Guns .
579  Lots of guns .	 No one has ever done anything like this .
581  Perhaps we\' re asking the wrong questions .	 Leave me with him .
582  Now .	 Hold on , Morpheus .
583  They\' re coming for you .	 They\' re coming .
586  I can\' t stand it any longer .	 It\' s the smell .
587  If there is such a thing .	 I feel saturated by it .
589  It\' s repulsive .	 Isn\' t it ?
590  I must get out of here .	 I must get free .
591  And in this mind is the key .	 My key .
595  Keys , loose change .	 Please remove any metallic items you\' re carrying .
596  Keys , loose change .	 Holy shit !
597  Backup .	 Send backup .
598  Freeze !	 What were you doing ?
599  He doesn\' t know .	 Know what ?
600  I think they\' re trying to save him .	 There is no spoon .
601  Find them and destroy them !	 We\' re under attack !
602  Help !	 Only human .
603  Dodge this .	 - How did you do that ?
604  - Do what ?	 You moved like they do .
606  Can you fly that thing ?	 Not yet .
607  Operator .	 I need a pilot program for a B- 212 helicopter .
608  Hurry .	 Let\' s go .
609  No .	 Morpheus , get up .
610  Get up , get up .	 He\' s not going to make it .
611  Got you .	 I knew it .
612  He\' s the One .	 Do you believe it now , Trinity ?
615  Operator .	 - It\' s good to hear your voice .
616  - We need an exit .	 Got one ready .
617  Subway station , State and Balboa .	 Damn it !
618  The trace was completed .	 We have their position .
619  Sentinels are standing by .	 Order the strike .
620  They\' re not out yet .	 You first , Morpheus .
622  Everything the Oracle told me has come true .	 Everything but this .
623  But what ?	 - What happened ?
624  - An agent .	 Send me back .
625  I can\' t .	 Mr. Anderson .
626  Run , Neo .	 Run .
627  What is he doing ?	 He\' s beginning to believe .
628  You\' re empty .	 You\' re empty .
629  You\' re empty .	 So are you .
631  Jesus , he\' s killing him .	 You hear that , Mr. Anderson ?
633  Goodbye , Mr. Anderson .	 My name . . .
634  . . . is Neo .	 - What happened ?
635  - I don\' t know .	 I lost him .
636  Oh , shit .	 Sentinels .

9  - but my hunger won\xe2\x80\x99 t - Riders coming .	 Please join .
13  - Second best .	 - He\' s second to no one .
14  - He is no one but a cripple .	 Leave now .
15  Not without the taxes .	 I\xe2\x80\x99 ve paid my taxes to the King .
19  - D\' Artagnan !	 Please .
21  - My father was a Musketeer .	 - I know .
22  Planchet .	 Not here .
23  I\' ve heard otherwise .	 You\' ve heard wrong .
27  It\' s a rather tricky journey .	 I will be your guide .
31  I taught him how to live .	 I don\' t understand .
33  I can see it in your eyes .	 You will become a Musketeer .
35  If you teach me , I will listen .	 I\' d be honored .
36  Whoa .	 Whoa .
38  You have money ?	 Yes .
39  - Who invited you ?	 - The space is free .
40  Move .	 You\' re attracting flies .
41  Forgive my associate .	 Strangers make him anxious .
43  Get out !	 Go on , go away !
44  - Where are you going ?	 - Paris .
45  - Oh , what business takes you there ?	 - Mine .
46  Stop !	 Put down your sword or he\' s dead .
48  I think you do care .	 - Why did you come here ?
49  - I wanted to watch .	 - I will kill him !
51  You have an interesting fighting style .	 Where did you acquire it ?
52  Here and there .	 Perhaps there .
57  He doesn\' t have men outside !	 He\' s -- He\' s bluffing .
58  Let him go now .	 He doesn\' t mean much to me .
62  Hyah !	 Whoa !
63  Why are we stopping ?	 We are emissaries from the King of Spain .
66  Oh , thank you .	 Hello ?
67  Monsieur Revile ?	 - Your guard\xe2\x80\x99 s too low .
68  - Nothing wrong with my guard .	 I\' m looking for Monsieur Revile .
69  He is not receiving visitors .	 He will receive me .
72  May we give Revile a message ?	 You may give him this .
73  Just the name will do .	 My father was a Musketeer .
74  Revile gave him this sword .	 I\' m Porthos .
75  This is Aramis .	 - We , too , are Musketeers .
76  - You two ?	 Musketeers ?
77  - So much for civility .	 - I\' m sorry .
81  Cardinal Richelieu .	 Or so he professes to .
82  The Musketeers have been suspended .	 Replaced by Richelieu\' s own private guards .
84  In the Cardinal\' s jail .	 We must get him out of jail .
85  Well , that seems unlikely .	 What of the King ?
86  These are his Musketeers .	 Surely he will want us to free Revile .
88  Perhaps one more secret .	 The name of a place to stay .
89  Certainly .	 Your guard\' s too low .
93  - You\' ve gone too far .	 I wish to scare the Spaniards .
94  Embarrass the King .	 I want political tension , not war .
102  She\' s lovely .	 Not if you must live with her .
104  Sorry , Francesca .	 Gout .
105  Puts me in a foul humor .	 Show monsieur a room .
106  I have some pressing book work .	 Is he always like that ?
107  No .	 He\' s never apologized before .
108  Why do you stay ?	 He is all the family I have .
110  The room .	 Yes .
111  Yes , of course .	 Ohh !
113  Stairs can do that .	 Do you have a name ?
114  A name ?	 Yes , of course .
115  Uh , D\' Artagnan .	 Are you certain ?
117  Once we were filled with would- be Musketeers .	 What happened ?
118  They kept getting killed .	 This is the best room .
120  You\' re beautiful .	 I\' m sorry .
121  It just came out .	 I\' ve embarrassed you .
122  No .	 Does every man tell you you\' re beautiful ?
123  Yes .	 Will there be anything else ?
126  Nothing like this .	 They\' re far fussier than I am .
129  This coach , for one .	 And those pathetic horses , for another .
130  Not to mention your clothes .	 You see , everyone is rude here .
131  Paris is the rudeness capital of the world .	 - Move this trash .
132  - Not until you apologize to my horses .	 Apologize to your horses ?
133  They\' re very sensitive .	 You\' ve hurt their feelings .
134  Be thankful that\' s all we do .	 Now move .
136  Do you know who we are ?	 No .
137  Do you know who I am ?	 Good .
138  No .	 In their hearts , I believe they wanted to apologize .
140  Ohh !	 - You !
141  - Me ?	 A Cardinal\' s Guard .
143  And so would you .	 Perhaps .
145  What do you suggest ?	 That you trust me .
146  A stranger ?	 Dressed as a Cardinal\' s Guard ?
148  Freeing Treville .	 How ?
150  Or 15 to 3 .	 We\' re drunks , not fools .
151  Why risk your life ?	 You\' re not one of us .
153  - Wine from the Cardinal .	 The Cardinal ?
154  Yes .	 Leave it .
155  - Who was it ?	 - Someone delivering wine ... from the Cardinal .
156  A gift from the Cardinal ?	 Don\' t open it !
157  Well , we wanted to see how good you are .	 And ?
158  You\' re quite good .	 You\' re gonna need to be better .
159  Revile ?	 Here !
160  Over here !	 The keys .
161  Which key ?	 Guess .
163  Monsieur Treville will slice your throat .	 I couldn\' t bear the guilt .
164  The black one .	 Wise choice .
165  - Whoa !	 - Planchet .
166  My old friend .	 - You are too old for this .
169  D\' Artagnan .	 Aw , home sweet home .
170  Forced into hiding .	 Is this any better than prison ?
171  Well , the food will be .	 D\' Artagnan ,
177  We have our own toast .	 D\' Artagnan , draw your sword .
180  Is that not right , Aramis ?	 Perhaps later .
181  You both know her ?	 Yes .
182  Well , she knows many of the men in this room .	 No .
183  Many of the men in Paris .	 You fight amongst yourselves ?
184  Oh , a man has to fight with someone .	 Silence !
185  Quiet !	 Silence , please !
186  Please , quiet !	 Thank you .
187  I have an introduction to make .	 Men , please !
192  The Englishman ?	 Buckingham .
196  Who can do it ?	 How about the would- be Musketeer ?
198  Humility is so boring .	 We\' ve all seen you fight .
199  I\' m not fighting now .	 Come on .
200  Take it .	 Next time , listen to him .
201  You\' re no Musketeer .	 You\' re a sheepherder .
202  Go drink with the sheepherders .	 Pay no attention to Athos .
203  He envies your youth .	 Have you got dung in your ears ?
204  Go !	 Yes .
207  Yes .	 We can all see how much better with a sword .
208  Too petrified to move .	 I do not wish to fight a Musketeer .
210  Athos was ... testing you .	 Testing me ?
211  Yes .	 Judging you .
212  Measuring you .	 That is not a happy walk , D\xe2\x80\x99 Artagnan .
214  Something is going to happen .	 I know it .
216  I can\' t do it alone .	 \' Ask the Musketeers .
217  They don\' t seem very cooperative .	 They are loyal .
218  \' Ask them .	 - This is not what you think .
223  - You can turn around now .	 It\' s perfectly safe .
224  My back .	 Are there , uh , any on my back ?
225  A few .	 You\' re not very brave .
227  I was up there chasing away a rat .	 A sewer rat .
229  My mother came from Spain with the Queen .	 She was her seamstress .
230  Perhaps more .	 Perhaps her confidante .
234  Shut up !	 You cleaned the palace sewers ?
236  Tell me about the palace sewers .	 Where they go .
237  How you get in .	 Everything .
238  Go crawl around in them yourself .	 Over here with the torch .
244  Crocodiles attack from behind .	 Slow down !
245  Bonacieux , slow down !	 Where did he go ?
248  Hurry up there !	 Henri !
249  Henri !	 Henri !
250  Hmm ?	 Uh , more bread .
251  We need more bread .	 Can you get some , please ?
252  Does he mean you or me ?	 I thought I was the baker .
253  Me .	 There\' s blood on your apron .
254  You think that came from a croissant ?	 Oh .
255  Uh , right .	 Oh , God -- God bless .
256  Thank you , thank you .	 Mister .
257  Wine , please .	 Nice sword .
259  Well , long enough .	 Do you keep your sword polished ?
262  Come on , you make bread like a butcher .	 Hurry !
263  Hurry !	 I wanted to be the butcher .
264  What now ?	 Add the salt .
265  Hey , you !	 Hurry with these two .
266  What do I use for ducks ?	 The smaller one .
267  Shoo !	 Shoo !
268  Fly away !	 You can thank me later .
269  This wine is rejuvenating .	 Don\' t get too rejuvenated .
270  It\' s begun .	 Stop !
271  Stop !	 Stop !
272  I order you to stop !	 Where are your guards ?
274  - Who are you ?	 Your Musketeers .
276  I will stay .	 Someone has to confront this madness .
278  Hello .	 Hello .
281  Why ?	 Will you keep leaping out at me ?
284  Perhaps because you said I was beautiful .	 You are .
286  Come , come .	 This way .
287  Come on .	 The Cardinal demands to see you .
289  Quickly .	 Quickly .
290  - You\' ve got him !	 - There he is !
292  You warned D\' Artagnan .	 You want to get us all slaughtered ?
294  Is that what you want ?	 And worse yet .
298  That\' s more like it --	 Remember ... we\' re family .
299  That sad fact ... is all that keeps you alive .	 Up !
300  My - My dear niece , may I say something ?	 No .
303  Yes - Yes .	 Very clear .
304  You explained it quite well .	 Get out !
307  Who are you , D\' Artagnan ?	 Where are you from ?
315  The Queen is manipulative .	 The Spanish and the English are opportunistic .
322  - I helped them free Revile .	 Such honesty .
323  Such stupidity .	 I assumed Your Eminence was not aware Revile was jailed .
327  Or eliminating .	 I think he\' s the most dangerous kind of man .
330  Call it a weakness .	 I want him alive , for the moment .
332  - When ?	 Will it be soon ?
333  - Yes .	 Good .
335  - Or wise .	 What is not wise is hiding here ,
344  It does you an injustice .	 - I will deal with her .
345  - I\' m certain that you will .	 Your Highness .
348  They\' il expect it .	 They\' re counting on it .
349  That\' s what makes it fun .	 Francesca !
350  I need your help .	 Yes , of course .
351  Anything .	 You could start by taking the pistol from my head .
352  Sorry .	 Please , come with me .
353  Where ?	 We escort the Queen .
355  No , the King does not know .	 Richelieu does not know .
356  No one must know .	 Not now , not later .
357  I must have your word on that .	 You have .
358  But you could wait one moment .	 There\' s no time for that .
359  Well , there\' s no time for that .	 Are you bragging ?
360  I will wait outside .	 Don\' t deny you\xe2\x80\x99 re cheating .
362  Good morning , D\' Artagnan .	 You may close your mouth now .
365  D\xe2\x80\x99 Artagnan !	 We\' ve been looking for you .
366  We need your help .	 We ride to free the Musketeers .
367  I ... cannot go .	 Cannot go ?
371  I\' il get some food .	 Don\' t leave the coach .
372  Hey .	 Hmm .
377  - I very much doubt it .	 - You\' re Hessian .
379  You have insulted me !	 This is foolish .
381  - Enthusiastically .	 I\' m enjoying this .
384  Hyah !	 Hyah !
385  Hyah !	 - Get down .
386  Hold tight !	 - What is it ?
387  Come on !	 Hyah !
388  Hyah !	 Hyah !
389  Hey !	 - Whatever happens , you keep going .
390  - Hyah !	 Hyah !
391  Hyah !	 You\' d be best going .
394  - Mmm .	 - And this is D\' Artagnan , a new friend .
399  - What\' s not good ?	 The lead horse lost a shoe .
401  It could be hours .	 Days .
402  Weeks .	 How can we go ?
405  - They were murdered .	 - I\' m sorry .
406  I was there .	 I watched .
407  Couldn\' t stop it .	 You were a boy .
409  In the beginning , yes .	 It\' s all I thought about .
410  Planchet , he raised me .	 He taught me everything .
413  How else am I to learn ?	 Are you like your father ?
414  I\' m still trying .	 - Don\' t look at me like that .
415  - Like what ?	 - Those eyes .
416  - They\' re the only eyes I have .	 It\' s unfair .
419  Thank you .	 When you look at me like that ,
422  Don\' t .	 I don\' t believe we\' ve had the pleasure .
423  Who are you ?	 - Your pallbearer , if you hurt her .
424  - In truth , I know who you are .	 D\' Artagnan .
426  But , first --	 Where is the Queen ?
427  Where is the Queen ?	 - No .
428  - Do not tell him !	 - The lady gives unsound advice .
430  Where is the Queen ?	 Hmm ?
431  Oh , how touching .	 The Tear of Brionne .
433  Thank you for your cooperation .	 Bring her .
434  Fire away , boys .	 Come on , girl .
436  Just one ?	 I\' m insulted .
437  Don\' t be .	 For whom do you do this ?
438  For my own pleasure .	 Now write the letter .
439  Richelieu ?	 No , he wouldn\' t go that far .
440  He believes that rhetoric conquers nations .	 - Chaos conquers nations .
441  - Did you kill the Spanish envoy ?	 Yes .
442  Write the letter .	 You bring us to the brink of war .
443  Now it\' s time to push you over .	 Write the letter .
446  You have ... no children .	 No .
447  But you like children .	 Of course you do .
448  Everybody likes children .	 Except for me .
451  - Is there no mercy in your heart ?	 - No mercy .
452  No heart .	 Take this to Grenouille .
454  The rest of you , join the others in DuChamps .	 What happened ?
455  He came back .	 And did you kill him ?
457  He escaped , sir .	 Who is D\' Artagnan ?
458  Whose throat do I have to cut now ?	 Hmm ?
459  Perhaps a little boy ?	 I know .
460  A little boy and a nun .	 Prepare DuChamps castle for hell .
461  I have business in Paris .	 I\' il be with you soon .
462  She\' s gone .	 The Queen ?
463  And Francesca .	 - Who did this ?
464  - A man in black .	 He is without pity , without remorse .
465  Where did he take them ?	 Monsieur !
466  Monsieur !	 You\' re a friend of the Queen\' s ?
467  Yes .	 You brought her here ?
468  Yes .	 I know where she is .
469  Where ?	 DuChamps castle .
470  And a young woman ?	 He took her too .
474  He would have .	 You\' re lucky .
475  He has an army .	 What will you do ?
476  Get an army of my own .	 And find him .
477  When you do , give him this .	 I will .
478  Come on .	 Come on , boy .
480  We\' re almost there .	 It\' s just ahead .
481  You see ?	 Come on , Strega .
482  Come on , Strega .	 Just a little further .
483  Go on .	 No , rest , Strega .
484  I will come back for you .	 I didn\' t hear you knock .
485  Tell me about D\xe2\x80\x99 Artagnan .	 He would have knocked .
486  Tell me where he comes from .	 Tell me about his parents .
487  Why ?	 I know his name .
488  Ask him yourself .	 No , I\' m asking you .
489  Get out of here .	 Get out !
490  Tell me about D\' Artagnan .	 You\' re a madman .
494  What\' s the importance to you ?	 Oh , my God .
495  It\xe2\x80\x99 s you .	 - You killed his family .
496  - He wants revenge .	 He wants to be a Musketeer .
499  Febre !	 - He has gone too far .
501  I will kill the Queen .	 And Buckingham .
505  - Buckingham arrives tonight .	 - I gave no orders for that .
507  So you plot the course of history now .	 You are indeed mad .
508  That\' s three times !	 It must be so .
509  You cannot do this , Febre !	 And what would you do ...
510  Your Eminence ?	 Damn me to hell ?
513  Controlling ?	 I will stop him !
514  Arm yourself !	 If you insist .
515  Sorry you had to come all that way for this .	 Lord Buckingham ?
516  From the Queen .	 Well , there\' s no seal .
518  We go to DuChamps .	 Are you gonna shoot me ?
520  What happened here ?	 Someone said they saw a man .
521  In black .	 Leaving the villa .
524  So then I have killed him .	 He was worried about you .
530  I know who did this .	 Febre .
531  The one that does your bidding .	 This is not my bidding .
532  He is gone mad .	 He was always mad .
536  He says you did it .	 I will stop him .
537  I will pray .	 Pray for your success .
539  Is this your answer ?	 I\' ve been practicing .
540  We don\' t want you here .	 Are you afraid of Febre ?
541  We\' ve come to this .	 The Musketeers afraid of one man .
546  Really ?	 And where were your allegiances when we asked for your help ?
547  I had to escort the Queen .	 - I was sworn to secrecy .
548  - Escort the Queen ?	 Or was it the chambermaid ?
549  Hate me all you want , but act !	 - Defend your country .
550  - A country that has scorned us .	 Then do it as Musketeers .
552  " All for one , and one for all . "	 Candle wicks .
553  Ten of them .	 Dipped in Armagnac .
555  Where are we going ?	 Probably to die .
556  Strega ?	 Can you get Strega ?
558  Saddling a horse .	 Not your saddle .
559  Not your horse .	 I have to borrow them .
560  Steal them , you mean .	 But then , you\' re a Musketeer !
563  How did you know Febre has Francesca ?	 I heard talk .
564  I -- There was no talk .	 No one knew .
565  You\' re wrong !	 No , you listen .
569  - Am I truly crazy ?	 - Let me answer that .
570  I\' ve known you longer .	 You\' ve changed your mind ?
572  You cannot do this .	 You\' re right .
574  What scheme is that ?	 I shall ride with you .
575  As shall we .	 We\' il take them by surprise .
576  Yes .	 They\' re expecting an army .
577  Well , perhaps we shall not disappoint them .	 Whoa !
578  Keep watch , Strega .	 You\' ve done enough .
579  It\' s our turn .	 You dropped this .
580  It\' s begun .	 - All for one ...
581  - and one for all !	 Come on !
582  We\' il have to charge the damn thing !	 Come on !
583  Come on !	 I need men over here !
584  Push it back .	 Back !

589  Come on !	 Push .
590  Push !	 Keep going !
591  Come on !	 Now stop !
593  I don\' t know .	 Then die here .
594  Francesca !	 Come here .
595  Now get up .	 No .
596  I wanted you here for this .	 This will just take a moment .
597  No !	 Francesca !
598  I\' m not dead .	 Now , will you please go kill him ?
599  Time to dance .	 That\' s from a young friend .

627  - Aye	 Congratulations , Mr McElroy .
628  An outstanding round of golf .	 You ain\' t seen nothing yet .

1  You know the problem with Hollywood ?	 They make shit .
4  Realism .	 Not a pervasive element in modern American cinematic vision .
5  Take Dog Day Afternoon , for example .	 Arguably Pacino\' s best work .
7  The cinematography , the acting , the screenplay , all topnotch .	 But ...
9  Really wanted that .	 Now this is the tricky part .
12  What , still no bus ?	 Come on .
14  There\' s no CNN .	 There\' s no CNBC .
15  There\' s no Internet .	 Fast- forward to today .
17  In hours .	 It would be the biggest story from Boston to Budapest .
18  Ten hostages die .	 Twenty , thirty .
19  Relentless .	 Bam , bim .
20  One after another .	 All on hi- def , computer- enhanced .
21  You can almost taste the brain matter .	 All for what ?
24  - There\' s a problem with that movie .	 - Really ?
25  - It wouldn\' t work .	 - How come ?
26  - Audiences love happy endings .	 - Pacino escapes with the money .
27  Boyfriend gets a sex change .	 Live happily ever after .
28  - No ?	 - No .
29  Homophobia .	 Bad guy can\' t win .
32  Gotta jet .	 Thanks for the coffee .
33  Stan .	 Time to go to work .
34  You coming ?	 Move .
35  I won\' t say it again .	 I have a clear shot .
36  Shooters , stand by .	 Okay .
37  Now what ?	 Don\' t worry , folks , it\' s almost over .
38  Is she done ?	 - She\' s done .
39  - Move her out .	 Don\' t worry , you\' il be fine .
40  You\' il be back before you know it .	 Turn the fuck around .
41  Rescue team , let\' s go .	 Who\' s on the roof ?
42  All shooters , you are holding for command .	 You\' re doing good .
43  Behave yourself .	 Look over there , and there .
44  All prepare their shot .	 - What are you doing ?
45  - I\' m handling this !	 Don\' t fuck with this guy !
47  We got a team over there .	 Double this team up .
48  That\' s your best angle .	 Don\' t talk .
51  They got the green light .	 I got this guy on the phone !
55  - Stand down !	 - Get back !
56  - Get back !	 - Officer , stand down now !
57  He\' s gonna shoot !	 He\' s gonna shoot !
58  Shit .	 Get her !
59  Go !	 No !
60  Release the hostage !	 No !
61  Release the hostage !	 She\' s gone .
62  Take cover !	 No , no !
63  Let her go !	 Let her go !
64  Release the hostage !	 Help me !
65  Let her go .	 Let her go !
66  - Jesus .	 - Shit !
67  You guys , come on !	 - How long will you be here ?
68  - One week .	 - Business or pleasure ?
69  - Hopefully both .	 - What type of work do you do ?
70  - I\' m a consultant .	 Excuse me .
71  Could you be careful with that ?	 That\' s expensive equipment .
72  - How long will this take ?	 - A few minutes .
73  Sit down , relax .	 I\' il be right back .
74  A few minutes , huh ?	 Hey , where\' s he going ?
75  It\' s going up .	 Stairs .
76  Sir , could you please -- ?	 Easy , easy .
77  This better be important .	 Wouldn\' t have asked you otherwise , senator .
80  - They know he\' s working for us ?	 - It\' s unlikely .
81  It was a routine check .	 Torvalds freaked out .
82  They got lucky .	 This ain\' t good .
83  What do the feds know ?	 Nothing yet .
85  - So we haven\' t been compromised ?	 - I\' m not sure .
87  I understand , senator .	 There you go .
88  Well , well , well .	 Who are you supposed to be ?
89  - I\' m Ginger .	 - Ginger , huh ?
91  Surprised ?	 I know everything about you , Stan .
92  What are you selling again ?	 My employer wants to meet you .
93  - Shit .	 - You\' re not too good at golf .
94  You\' re fucking up my chi .	 Let me have that .

116  - She will never be your child .	 Forget Holly .

124  Judas .	 That should get you started .
125  Hundred grand .	 What do you got to lose ?
126  He just wants to meet you .	 One time .
128  - That\' s it .	 And you keep the money .
129  What did he say ?	 All right , look , look .
131  These allegations are not recognized as crimes .	 Your laws don\' t apply .
133  - He said IKEA is Swedish .	 He understands English , huh ?
134  - Let me talk to him .	 - He\' s all yours .
138  Did he really say that ?	 You\' re funny .
139  - How much do you weigh ?	 - How much do I weigh ?
140  We\' il call you if we need you .	 Eat a dick .

179  You should not be surprised by this .	 We know quite a bit .
182  I like him .	 In that case , so do I.
185  I understand .	 Chechnya is an internal affair .
189  It is none of your concern .	 Stability is our concern .
193  That went well .	 - Who\' s the guy with Nemerov ?
194  - Anatoli Grushkov .	 Old KGB ?
195  Been lurking around since Brezhnev .	 Plays all sides .
201  I sent three people .	 They all died trying .
202  What does the T- shirt say ?	 " I am a bomb technician .
203  If you see me running ... try to catch up . "	 Sir ?
204  I\' m sorry .	 Just one quick thing .
206  I only count 14 .	 Doctors Milinov , Orlov and Spassky .

227  I\' il see you at the car .	 Still loving your desk job ?

240  We could get a room .	 - I already did .
247  Let\' s talk response .	 - Worst thing we could do is nothing .
249  Biological ?	 Nuclear ?
250  Okay .	 Short of gassing the Kremlin , what\' s our strongest response ?
251  - We send in peacekeepers .	 - Chechnya\' s not sovereign .
252  They requested recognition , so we recognize them .	 Not full diplomatic recognition .
253  Provisional .	 Then we get the Chechens to request emergency international assistance .
255  - Fly them in from Turkey .	 - Over Armenian airspace ?
256  To screw Russia , they won\' t complain .	 Let\' s do it .
257  Nemerov can choke on it .	 Bill .
258  Dr. Ryan .	 - Yes , sir ?
272  I am not affected .	 I remain devoted to our little plan .

292  You have a good one .	 Yeah , brother .
296  They haven\' t moved .	 Why haven\' t they moved ?
297  - Nemerov\' s too smart to move tanks .	 - He speaks .
300  It\' s a chess game .	 He\' s thinking three moves ahead .
306  Why does he need to build a secret one ?	 Deniability .
308  No way to track it .	 No way to trace it .

9  What look ?	 You tell me !
15  The civil wars were over .	 Men smiled at one another in public .
16  But the fighting never stopped .	 Fishing for votes ?
17  No , just enjoying our democratic way of life .	 A new wine .
18  From Spain .	 Delicious .
20  - A great victory by Pompey .	 - Another ?
29  Ahoy , Batiatus .	 What brings you up from Capua ?
33  - You flatter me .	 - No , not in the least .
34  Look at this beauty .	 And a virgin .
37  Good teeth .	 Wide hips .
38  And an excellent breeder .	 Magnificent .
41  Don\' t worry , my friend .	 I won\' t bid against you .
43  - Of course .	 - Five hundred sesterces !
45  It would be a close vote .	 I bought you a gift .
46  It\' s beautiful .	 - You are too generous .
47  - Am I ?	 Well , I suppose I might be .
50  It\' s true cost .	 What is hell ?
53  His name :	 Spartacus .
54  Pick it up !	 Pick it up !
55  No !	 Stop !
56  So he\' s a Thracian , yes ?	 Worse .
57  He\' s an animal .	 Good .
58  That\' s even better .	 This is your lucky day , Thracian .
59  What kind of a place is this ?	 Move !
60  Fresh meat !	 Shut your hole !
61  Get back to work .	 You stink , animals .
62  Clean yourselves .	 This way .
64  I could get used to this .	 I am Gannicus .
65  This is Spartacus .	 David the Jew .
66  He never talks .	 Some say he can\' t .
67  You\' re Thracians ?	 - The crowd likes Thracians .
68  - Be quiet , Nordo .	 Eat .
69  Didn\' t get your name , friend .	 You\' re not my friend .
70  I don\' t wanna know your name , your story .	 Why not ?
73  Eat .	 You must be the new Thracians .
74  I can almost tell Thracians .	 You stink like pigs .
75  - You must be Crixus .	 - You\' ve heard of me .
76  Who hasn\' t ?	 " Crixus the big nose . "
77  Not surprised you could smell us .	 Enough !
78  To your cells !	 Now !
79  Well , move , slaves !	 You , Spartacus .
81  Fighting Romans .	 Crassus .
83  I do not disdain the public .	 You love mankind .
86  Times have changed .	 Rome rules the world now .
88  The educated ?	 The wealthy ?
89  The aristocrat ?	 By Crassus ?
91  That leaves Pompey out .	 Julius Caesar , you mean .
98  You , slave .	 Pick it up .
99  Come at me .	 Again .
100  Too slow , slave .	 Pick it up .
101  Too slow .	 Cinna !
103  They have spirit , but no real talent .	 I see .
105  Don\' t damage my property .	 Enough !
106  Go !	 Bring her .
107  Come .	 Come here .
108  Very good .	 Better .
109  Come .	 Let me smell your hair .
110  You know ...	 I can be a very good master .
111  Oh , yes .	 Now , now ...
112  - now kiss me .	 - No !
113  No !	 Hold her !
114  Hey , Spartacus .	 - How\' s your nose ?
115  - You got lucky .	 Do I have to break it again ?
116  - So where did you fight Romans ?	 - Thrace .
117  - You ?	 - Gaul , where I was caught .
118  And then later in Sicily where slaves rebelled .	 - You rebelled ?
119  - Two times .	 The Romans were terrified of us .
121  Why did it fail ?	 Fighting Romans is like fighting a grist mill .
123  Faster !	 Put your backs into it , you sons of whores !
126  Nordo , this man is trouble .	 Leave him be .
128  Enough talking !	 Back to work .
129  Well , move , you scum !	 Put your body behind the blow !
130  Good , Draba !	 Push him back .
131  Faster !	 Harder !
137  Lost your appetite ?	 Eat .
138  Drink .	 - Tomorrow we die .
139  - I\' m not dying tomorrow .	 The gods decide when we die .
141  When I look at the heavens I see only stars .	 Blasphemer !
142  You could be struck down for that .	 No bolt of lightning .
143  - So what do you believe in ?	 - Us .
144  Our will .	 We decide when we die and how .
145  Well , eat anyway .	 You\' il need your strength for tonight .
146  - What happens tonight ?	 - War , little Thracian .
147  Sweet war !	 Quiet !
148  Sit down !	 A little wisdom .
150  - He is a man .	 - Yeah !
151  And a man needs a woman .	 Quiet , quiet .
154  Cinna !	 This is yours .
155  Idiot !	 David doesn\' t fight tomorrow .
156  Crixus .	 You like to play rough , Thracian .
157  Here .	 Batiatus asks that she be made more pliant .
158  See to it .	 I\' m Spartacus .
159  What are you called ?	 You look cold .
160  Here .	 The stones are cold at night .
161  You sleep there .	 I won\' t bother you .
162  Wake up , you sons of whores !	 Move already !
163  My name is Varinia .	 Varinia .
166  - Capua .	 They fight today .
167  The Thracian , the one they call Spartacus .	 Is he any good ?
168  Couldn\' t say .	 He\' s different , though .
169  How ?	 All the gladiators here are strong men .
170  Brave .	 But they are still slaves .
171  They accept it .	 Not him .
172  He will not last long .	 You were with him last night ?
173  - Yes and no .	 - You , girl !
174  Come here .	 You will attend me at the games .
176  Now , go and get yourself cleaned up .	 Line up !
178  Thank you .	 And I appreciate the loan of your troops .
180  - Of course .	 More wine !
181  A perfectly ripened pear .	 - Although somewhat bruised .
182  - A problem with discipline .	 But we\' re working on it .
183  Aren\' t we ?	 Yes , my Lord .
184  - On the crosses .	 Who are they ?
185  - Arsonists .	 They wear the tunica molesta , soaked in pitch .
187  Burn !	 Burn !
188  Crixus verses Gaius .	 Gannicus verses Antonius .
190  He\' s the real thing , through and through .	 Any good ?
191  Cinna thinks the world of him .	 Don\' t you , Cinna ?
192  Very well .	 A thousand on Spartacus .
193  Kill !	 Kill !
194  Kill !	 Kill !
196  I was wrong .	 - A slave has no choice .
198  Good move , Thrace !	 Harder !
199  Faster !	 Put your back to it !
202  - Slaves don\' t marry .	 - I would marry you .
211  - I will be yours ...	 - Until the day ...
212  Until the day I die .	 And in the life beyond .
213  - Can you tell there\' s life after ?	 - I have faith .
214  There will be no other man but you .	 I swear .
215  Kill !	 Kill !
216  Kill !	 Kill !
217  Spartacus !	 Master , we have visitors , Master , from Rome .
218  Cornelius Lucius and his wife , Helena .	 And Marcus Crassus .
220  You do me a great honor , sir .	 I am Lentulus Batiatus .
221  Please , sit .	 I and my establishment are here to serve you .
224  Excellent choice .	 Your Honor is obviously a connoisseur .
225  - To the death .	 - To the death ?
227  That\' s very good .	 - Very amusing .
228  - I am not laughing .	 Of course you\' re not .
231  Certainly won\' t see quality .	 Madame .
233  - I want to give you good fighting .	 Good fighting .
234  And to the death .	 I want to see courage .
235  I want to see passion .	 And above all ...
236  I want to see finality .	 But to the death will cost you ...
238  Done .	 And I want no fakery .
244  - But each kind has its virtues .	 Change of plan .
247  Yes , perhaps .	 But ...
251  Order !	 What is it ?
252  What is it ?	 A private fight .
253  - Who do you want ?	 - Draba .
254  And David .	 Now , he\' s a Jew , yes ?
256  This is interesting .	 Ever seen a Jew fight ?
258  Spartacus and Polymus .	 Spartacus ?
259  How do you like them ?	 All .
260  Except that one .	 I don\' t like him .
262  - Who will you match him with ?	 - With the African .
263  - What are you doing ?	 - Praying .
264  How do you pray ?	 I can show you .
267  One soul in two bodies .	 I will come back to you .
269  I am full of strength .	 Dagger against net and trident .
270  What kind of match is that ?	 Time .
271  Time !	 What are they thinking , I wonder ?
274  Would you like to see ?	 Bring me the Jew before he fights .
276  Unclothe .	 Unclothe .
277  They do that to their children ?	 How beastly .
279  - Of course , sir .	 - Strike !
280  - Kill him !	 Kill him !
281  - Kill him !	 - Kill him , Jew !
282  Why doesn\' t he kill him ?	 Kill him !
284  Live , Draba .	 That\' s what life is for .
287  - Kill him !	 - Kill him !
288  - Kill him !	 - Kill him !
289  - Kill him !	 - Kill him !
290  Kill him !	 Stop him !
293  Who chooses to die ?	 Who chooses to die ?
295  Father !	 It was just a dream .
296  No .	 I slept until now .
297  Now I wake .	 Move , you dogs !
298  Move !	 I said move !
302  So will we all .	 Are you my friend , Crixus ?
303  - Was Draba your friend ?	 - Yes .
304  And my teacher .	 - Did he teach you how to die ?
308  Treachery .	 Cinna , fetch me a black man .
309  Kill him .	 Now there will be no more trouble .
310  The dogs won\' t even growl .	 Move it , move it !
311  You cows !	 Move , slaves !
312  Are we dogs that you snap your whips at us ?	 - Spartacus !
313  Prepare to die !	 - Cinna !
314  What the hell is going on out there ?	 There\' s too many !
315  You taught me well , Cinna .	 Quiet !
316  - Quiet !	 - Let him speak !
317  Quiet !	 Listen to Spartacus !
318  Like you ...	 I\' ve been alone my whole life .
319  We could never look into each other\' s eyes .	 Living like animals .
320  Here is the lesson of Draba .	 I will be a man .
321  My life is my brother\' s .	 Live to fight the Romans !
322  Smash the gates !	 Master !
323  The gladiators !	 They have revolted !
325  Field formation !	 Go get my litter .
326  We have to get to Capua .	 To the garrison .
327  Go !	 Hold your positions !
328  Free men and women , listen to me !	 We must get ready .
330  - Spartacus , look .	 David , go .
331  Go .	 Talk to them .
333  Gifts !	 I bring gifts !
334  Freedom for you and your children !	 Come , join us !
335  Freedom for you !	 Join us !
336  Spartacus always said that you would speak some day .	 David , Varinia .
337  - Come .	 - You\' il tell me later .
338  There\' s one more thing I need to do .	 Maecenus !
339  Maecenus !	 Thank you , thank you .
340  You\' ve got to stop them .	 - Where\' s that slaves headed ?
342  You\' ve got to save something .	 - Too late for that .
343  Double time !	 - March !
344  Please .	 Please .
345  - Let\' s go .	 - Look .
346  They\' re so arrogant ...	 - they\' ve lost their formation .
348  And who fights better man to man than gladiators ?	 Crixus , Nordo .
349  We have guests .	 Should we not greet them ?
352  The entire garrison of Rome ?	 Are you out of your mind ?
353  To fight slaves ?	 How many of these creatures are there ?
355  They massacred the entire Capua garrison .	 The garrison at Capua .
357  We all remember Sicily .	 Twice the slaves ... attacked .
360  - And wait weeks for him to arrive ?	 Will the slaves wait ?
362  - But the entire city cohorts ?	 - Three .
363  - Three full cohorts .	 - Under whose command ?
369  They think the war is all won .	 It hasn\' t even started .
371  Like free men .	 Why did you propose Glabrus ?
372  He\' s as thick as he is vain .	 - But politically dependable .
379  The time has come to make some decisions .	 - We must leave ?
380  - And to where ?	 - I want to go home .
383  Come down , Crixus .	 This is Crixus the Gaul .
385  Can you bend this ?	 Now all of these .
386  We are like the arrows .	 Separately we\' re weak .
388  - We\' re one tribe then ?	 - Yes !
389  - Is that your will ?	 - Yes !
390  Who will lead us ?	 Stand up if you want to lead .
391  Spartacus .	 - Spartacus !
392  - Spartacus !	 - Spartacus !
393  - Spartacus !	 If that is your wish .
397  - Yeah !	 - I will not be a slave owner !
400  - Yes .	 - One people ?
401  - Yes !	 Is that your will ?
402  It is my will .	 - It is my will .
403  - It is my will .	 It is my will .
407  There\' s a forest fire or something .	 Tell them to go faster .
408  - Helena !	 - Faster !
409  Why are you stopping ?	 What is the meaning of this ?
411  Pick up your litters !	 Pick up your litters !
414  Helena and Cornelius Lucius ?	 - Are you sure ?
416  He has led them to Mt .	 Vesuvius .
420  You better .	 A child needs a father it can look up to .
421  A child ?	 We\' re going to have a child ?
423  - Sorry , my Lord .	 - We\' il camp here for tonight .
426  I like it .	 It\' s light but it\' s strong .
427  Spartacus , we need to talk .	 This is a war council .
429  Do women lead your armies ?	 Is that why Jews ...
434  " The people are tired .	 They need rest . "
436  How do we get off this mountain ?	 What\' s your plan ?
439  - You must have an idea .	 - Why must I ?
441  That we\' re all equal ?	 - Yes , but ...
442  - So one of you figure it out !	 He\' il be fine .
447  Your life .	 Our child\' s .
448  - I have faith you\' il find answers .	 - Where ?
449  - Within the soul you say I have ?	 - Yes .
454  And the plan is this .	 We will attack first .
457  You can tell us now .	 You are safe here .
458  I was asleep .	 I woke up to screaming .
459  The sound of screaming .	 I was screaming .
464  My name is Spartacus .	 I have a message for your Senate .
467  By all that Rome holds sacred ...	 I will see her honor restored .
469  Move and kill !	 Again .
470  Move and kill !	 Move and kill !
471  Faster !	 - They\' re looking better .
473  - Orsino is here .	 - The Sicilian pirate ?
474  What do we have to talk to him about ?	 A lot .
475  The key would help .	 Spartacus .
476  I could tell at once .	 You have such an air of command .
477  You here to do business or flatter me ?	 You\' ve done well .
479  - For yourself ?	 - For all of us .
483  Take it .	 A gift for our new alliance .
487  - Orsino or Crixus ?	 Either one .
493  - Take everything !	 - Making an army will take time .
497  - My choice by default .	 - There were and are better options .
500  Yes , that\' s right .	 You have none .
501  Very well .	 For now let us focus on Rome\' s defenses .
503  There are sixteen cohorts in Rome .	 We\' re outnumbered at Vesuvius .
504  Now ...	 - their bones rot in the fields .
507  Recall their legions .	 The real soldiers .
509  - and over the mountains to freedom .	 - Rome is north .
511  - Not just Rome .	 - And many of them ...
518  Sixty- forty on the contracts .	 I make no promises .
522  Hold , Crixus .	 We can\' t sacrifice everyone to save a few .
523  We\' re moving on .	 The stench is appalling .
526  The child is dead .	 - Varinia ?
527  - She must rest .	 - Our son .
528  - No .	 You\' re alive .
529  That\' s what matters most .	 I have failed you .
530  There will be others .	 I promise .
533  - We have to stop Spartacus .	 - But no more city cohorts .
535  The slaves ... have never encountered experienced soldiers before .	 Agreed .
540  Our farm .	 Sheep and goats .
541  - You still have kin there ?	 - No .
543  - How ?	 - He was the village headsman .
545  We haven\' t left yet .	 And at this rate ...
547  They\' re afraid .	 Rome has made its decision .
550  - They\' ve picked their site well .	 Blocked all major passes .
551  - And who\' s their general ?	 - Publius Maximus .
553  Fierce but unimaginative .	 - Two legions .
557  - A foolish tale .	 - Tell me .
562  - And ?	 - It cracked .
569  Let\' s fight .	 - Tell the skirmishers to move .
570  - Skirmishers !	 - Send in the first line .
571  - First line !	 Since when do slaves fight with cavalry ?
572  Stop the Romans !	 Slings and arrow !
573  Now !	 Hold your positions !
574  Stay firm !	 - They\' re killing them !
575  - Stay where you are !	 Signal the retreat !
576  Retreat !	 - They\' re breaking , my Lord .
577  - Finally .	 Allow the men to follow at will .
578  And take no prisoners !	 I killed him !
579  Publius Maximus is dead !	 Where is the rest of the Roman cavalry ?
581  South , I think .	 We\' ve left the camp unguarded !
582  Give me a horse !	 Varinia !
583  Varinia !	 Varinia !
584  We could .	 We ... we ...
585  It\' s all right .	 - What are you doing out here ?
586  - Thinking .	 You shouldn\' t be off by yourself like this .
587  Am I in danger ?	 She\' s carrying my child .
591  - What is it ?	 - Crixus .
592  Why should we leave ?	 Rome threw their best at us ...
593  - and we slaughtered them .	 - We cannot fight ...
594  - the whole Roman army .	 - Let them come .
596  - We\' re with you !	 - Yeah !
599  No .	 Crixus is right .
600  He is right !	 How clearly my wise brother Crixus sees the future .
604  Spartacus !	 Who is he ?
606  Nobody has suffered like I have .	 I\' m ruined .
608  Perhaps this will ease your suffering .	 Thank you , my Lord .
609  - Spartacus ?	 - Yes , yes .
611  Terrible thing , their murder .	 I never trusted him .
613  I heard rumors that Spartacus was wed .	 You mean Varinia ?
619  We could go .	 Just you and I.
621  These people put their trust in me .	 How can I desert them ?
627  - Yes !	 Noble Senators !
631  Our very lives .	 Only a fool or a traitor ...
632  - could oppose such measures .	 - Yes !
633  Crassus !	 Crassus !
634  Crassus !	 Crassus !
638  Crassus !	 Crassus !
639  Crassus !	 Don\' t the legions traditionally cheer Rome when they depart ?
641  We need to enlist some allies .	 Caesar will help .
646  The rest you get when we reach Sicily .	 Orsino ?
648  - Unless you are killed .	 Glabrus and Publius Maximus underestimated me too .
652  - How many legions ?	 - I count six standards .
653  - Commander ?	 - We caught one of their scouts .
654  Their general is Marcus Crassus .	 Crassus .
657  - No .	 No , no .
658  He is watching us .	 Spartacus .
659  I can feel it .	 Spartacus .
660  Attack , attack , attack !	 - Is that your answer for all ?
661  - It is a warrior\' s answer ...	 - not the slave\' s .
663  - Enough .	 We dealt with Publius .
664  We can deal with this .	 Publius was nothing compared to this .
665  And how do you know ?	 We\' ve met this man .
668  For now .	 For now .
671  He wants us to come to him .	 - And we will .
672  - Is that wise ?	 Both Glabrus and Publius played into his hands .
675  Listen .	 Do not , under any circumstances ... attack without my command .
677  - Halt !	 - Have the men rest for an hour .
680  - Yes , my Lord .	 Stand the men down !
681  Look at them .	 They have no idea we\' re here .
683  Spartacus !	 We\' re being flanked !
686  Time enough .	 Grab your weapons !
687  You come in good time .	 The attack begins shortly !
690  What\' s next ?	 - You\' re next , Crassus !
692  Kill them .	 Kill them ?
693  Who would throw away a fortune ?	 Aristocrats .
694  Sons of important families .	 What would Rome pay to have them back ?
697  We should make them fight for ours !	 Fight !
698  This isn\' t justice .	 This is revenge .
702  Count off !	 Fight !
703  Fight !	 Fight !
704  Fight !	 Fight like a man !
705  Kill !	 Kill !
707  You executed one hundred and fifty of your own men ?	 Roman citizens ?
709  And where is Spartacus now ?	 Traveling south , tracked by my troops .
716  I am your only miracle .	 I am your only cure .
719  The question is what ?	 Orsino .
720  May I offer you something to eat ?	 No .
721  Thank you .	 I had just finished my lunch when ...
722  - your invitation arrived .	 - Sit down .
730  - Rome has no navy .	 - I\' il build one .
732  Set up the signal .	 Let them know we are here .
735  Get that in here !	 Spartacus !
736  They\' ve gone .	 It\' s a trap .
737  It\' s a trap !	 Archers !
739  Fight , starve , or surrender .	 Those are our choices .
740  We\' re trapped .	 We\' il never get past that wall .
741  Perhaps we can make a deal .	 Rider approaching !
742  - Stand down !	 - Lower your weapons !
743  Spartacus !	 I\' m told I saw you fight once .
744  - I remember .	 - I don\' t particularly .
748  I have a proposition for you .	 My people go free .
751  I have you to thank .	 That day at Capua .
753  He inspired you ?	 He showed me how to fight back .
756  And I have all the time in the world .	 Do you ?
759  - And this is yours .	 Help me !
762  - I\' il be looking for you .	 - I\' m yours .
763  How could you do this ?	 How could you crucify ?
769  For me , for our son .	 It\' s not worth it .
770  They need to be light .	 Light but strong .
771  - These need to be longer .	 - Fifteen feet will do it .
772  Get it done .	 Very long .
773  My Lord , they\' re attacking the wall !	 - Where ?
774  - North .	 Near the Bay of Euphemia .
775  Move all of our available troops there .	 - Now !
776  - Yes .	 Sound the alarm !
777  Weapons ready !	 Wait !
778  Wait .	 - It\' s not him .
783  And if we\' re very lucky ...	 Spartacus will defeat them both .
785  - We should turn and attack .	 - Attack Crassus ?
786  Insane .	 Not Crassus or Pompey , but Rome .
791  - Who led us to the trap at Rhegium ?	 - Orsino .
792  No .	 Spartacus .
793  - You chose me as your leader !	 - Well , no more !
795  Put your weapons down , both of you .	 This is foolish .
798  Crixus doesn\' t need you .	 Crixus doesn\' t need anyone !
799  - Where will you go ?	 - Where my feet take me .
802  No one .	 We march !
806  He chose his own path .	 I failed him .
811  He who stops to loot is executed .	 Nothing slows us down .
815  - But I do .	 - There is no life without you .
816  - I am not important .	 - Not to me ?
817  Not to your son ?	 You were right , Varinia .
820  Live so that I will live .	 So that we will live on .
822  I\' il always be with you .	 Look .
824  Forgive me .	 I overslept .
825  We brought you a present .	 - He\' s beautiful .
826  - Fit for a king .	 I\' m not a king .
827  I\' m something better .	 A free man .
831  Spartacus !	 Spartacus !
832  Spartacus !	 Spartacus !
833  Spartacus !	 Spartacus !
834  Spartacus !	 Spartacus !

837  No fancy tactics .	 Head on .
838  One strong arm against another .	 Don\' t be greedy !
839  Crassus is mine !	 For Rome !
840  Spartacus , time to die !	 Freedom !
841  - The baby !	 It\' s started .
842  - It\' s all right .	 Spartacus , you have a son .
843  We found her !	 We found the wife of Spartacus !
844  Take him .	 Stay !
845  Varinia ?	 We think he was a close friend Of Spartacus .
846  What is your name ?	 Speak !
847  I won\' t lie to you .	 You\' re going to die .
848  But yours can be a painless death .	 I can do that .
849  Crucify the prisoners .	 My Lord , there are upwards of six thousand .
850  - All of them .	 - Yes , my Lord .
854  Pompey !	 Pompey !
855  Pompey !	 I merely did what any son of Rome would do .
860  Indeed .	 Now is the time to be generous .
862  I have led them in battle myself .	 I\' ve endured enumerable hardships .
868  This would be highly irregular .	 - Never in the Republic\' s history ...
869  - New times require new measures .	 - What say you , Senators ?
870  - Yes !	 Why won\' t you speak with me , Varinia ?
871  What was he like , Spartacus ?	 What was he like ?
872  He was just a man .	 - A simple man .
873  - No .	 He was a professional killer .
879  I can be ...	 I can be someone else .
880  Yes .	 Please love me .
881  Love me .	 He was something that you could never be .
882  Kill !	 Kill !
883  Kill !	 Kill !
884  - No !	 - Do you like the way it ends ?
885  I am Spartacus !	 Get out .
886  Get out !	 Here I am .
887  Do you still have nothing to say ?	 I will be back .
888  And I will be millions .	 Don\' t look at me like that .
889  I\' ve lost , Flavius .	 Rome has lost .
890  Outflanked by that toady Caesar .	 Don\' t you mean Crassus ?
891  Caesar is the real beneficiary here .	 - Tell me some good news .
893  Six thousand crucifixions I hear .	 Whole forests cut down .
895  But the corpse ... is Rome\' s .	 Civilization hangs on the cross .
896  What have we done ?	 Now tell me some dirt .
897  Gossip .	 I hear that Crassus has secretly taken ...
899  Even now , this Varinia ?	 War trophy , I imagine .
900  - Can I have a drink ?	 - Help yourself .
901  I would pay a lot ...	 - to steal her .
902  - Are you out of your mind ?	 - It would be suicide .
907  - We haven\' t much time , Agrippa .	 - Wait outside .
912  And Rome fought for what ?	 The whip and the cross .
916  Spartacus .	 Spartacus .
917  You shame me .	 You shamed us all .
920  - That pimp ?	 Who cares ?
921  Where is she ?	 Where is she ?
922  You\' re safe now .	 Thank you .
923  Good luck .	 And that is how we came here .
924  And how does the story end ?	 I don\' t know , Spartacus .

483  Except what you and your knights have done .	 You have your deeds .
489  Make way !	 Knights , my journey with you must end here .
494  - Does it all count for nothing ?	 - You ask me that ?
495  You who know me best of all ?	 Then do not do this .
496  Only certain death awaits you here .	 Arthur , I beg you !

501  Artorius !	 Rus !
502  Rus !	 The Roman Auxiliary has left the wall .
503  - And the horsemen ?	 - Leading a caravan away from the fort .

511  Arthur .	 Arthur .
512  ( horse whinnying )	 ( sighs ) Arthur .
513  Hm .	 Wherever I go on this wretched island I hear your name .

517  I fight for a cause beyond Rome\' s or your understanding .	 Ah .
518  You come to beg a truce .	 You should be on your knees .

560  Arthur !	 Artorius !
11  Thais , she loved it there .	 Women bring men home .
19  Keep that away from me .	 They called this tribe " monkey " .
20  It\' s a monkey .	 - Look , Roxane .
21  - Very intelligent .	 Hello , little man .
22  Do they speak ?	 No , but they do sing and make noises .
24  You know better , Machatas !	 What\' s your son going to say ?
27  Watch out for the serpent !	 Look out !

54  Cleitus !	 Cleitus !
61  Only when offered .	 Then why don\' t you refuse these vain flatteries ?
66  Who planned the Asian invasion ?	 Was it not your father ?
68  You insult me , Cleitus !	 You mock my family !
77  Arrest him for treason !	 Who\' s with him ?
78  Who\' s with him ?	 I call Father Zeus to witness .
80  Take him !	 You speak about plots against you ?
81  What about poor Parmenion ?	 You made me do your foul deed .
82  Have you no shame ?	 Hypocrite !
83  Despot !	 False King !
84  You and your barbarian mother live in shame !	 Cleitus ?
85  No .	 No .
86  Cleitus ?	 - Let me pass !
87  - None can enter , your Highness .	 I am the queen !
88  I want to see him .	 I\' ve waited 3 days .
89  He says none .	 Not even you .
90  He needs me !	 No .
91  He doesn\' t .	 And he needs you ?
92  Hephaistion , you make a mistake .	 The Army needs your reassurance ... ...

129  Get out .	 Go .
132  They blame me already behind my back !	 In secret !
133  Slander is not power .	 Shame is ?
135  Pausanias .	 He had help !
136  Did you help him ?	 No , never .
137  Why ?	 Why would I ?
141  That\' s a lie !	 He was my father , I loved him !
148  What do you know of Philip ?	 No , Alexander .
149  Zeus is your father .	 Act like it !
152  Damn your sorceress soul !	 Your soul is mine , Alexander .
153  No !	 No !
155  Stop acting like a boy !	 You\' re a king !

200  I paid for your bastard children !	 I\' ve taken nothing for myself !
201  And all I\' ve asked of you was one more month !	 Shame !
202  That\' s your King !	 What would your father say ?
203  I\' ve taken you further than my father ever dreamed !	 Too far !
204  So go home !	 I look to the barbarians for their courage !
206  Who said that ?	 We\' il never make it back to Macedonia !
207  You despicable coward !	 Come forth !
208  Make your accusations public !	 Why ?

250  Alexander !	 Alexander !
251  The King is down !	 To the King !
252  In the name of your king !	 Nearchus , how is he ?
253  How is he ?	 It was the bloodiest of his battles .
255  He lives !	 Alexander !
257  We love you !	 We\' re going home !
261  Just last night he was ...	 It\' s the water , Your Majesty !
262  He mixed it with the wine .	 But , how can this be ?
263  Typhus , of India ?	 I wouldn\' t tax yourself , Your Majesty .
265  I feel better .	 Soon , I\' il be up .
269  Please don\' t leave me , Hephaistion .	 My Alexander .
271  And then what happened ?	 Ours is a myth only young men believe .
272  But how beautiful a myth it was .	 We reach ... we fall .
273  Oh , Hephaistion !	 I worry for you without me .
274  I am nothing without you !	 Come , fight , Hephaistion !
275  We\' il die together .	 It\' s our destiny .
282  Hephaistion ?	 Hephaistion ?
283  Where is this Doctor ?	 I can\' t explain this , your Majesty .
284  It\' s not possible !	 I swear by Apollo --
285  Execute him !	 Take him out , now , and execute him !
286  Come away	 Liars !
287  Liars !	 You all hated him !

289  Get out , now !	 Be gone with you !
290  Harpies !	 Get out !
291  Get out !	 Are you drunk again ?
292  Get out .	 - He\' s dead .
294  Hephaistion is dead ?	 Are you mad ?
295  You monster !	 Are you mad ?
297  Obey me !	 I have your child !
299  We have a son !	 My poor , poor , ill- fated son !
300  Never touch me again !	 No !

309  Just three more months !	 Please live !
310  Alexander , we beg you .	 Tell us who .
311  Who will rule this great empire ?	 Who do you want , Alexander ?
312  Fear not .	 We are at the beginning .
313  The myth becomes real .	 Beyond Herakles ...
315  I\' il remember .	 Zeus is your father !
316  The Army will divide .	 Satrapies will revolt .
319  To the best .	 He said , " To the best . "
320  No , he said , " To Crateros . "	 To Crateros ?
321  Why would he say Crateros ?	 Babylon , Persia June 323 B. C.
331  By silence , we consented .	 Because we couldn\' t go on .
335  None of us did .	 That\' s the truth of his life .
338  You shall write ,	 He died of fever and a weakened condition .
340  He\' d have died a celebrated man .	 But this was not Alexander .
343  His failure towered over other men\' s successes .	 I\' ve lived ,

430  Sorry , sir .	 ( Sam strains )

433  Aren\' t the stars beautiful ?	 So beautiful .
436  So serene .	 So heavenly .
437  So admired and adored .	 Always looking down on everyone .
439  Honestly , is that all you ever think about ?	 Sure .
440  Whenever I\' m awake .	 I can\' t sleep .
442  She must be petrified .	 Pets ?

314  I\' m weepy .	 Jeff , you wanna wait outside ?
316  Come on , Verbal .	 Who do you think you\' re talking to ?
317  You expect me to believe that he retired ?	 For a woman ?
318  Bullshit !	 Keaton was using her .
319  He loved her .	 Sure .
323  Let me tell you something .	 I know Dean Keaton .
326  You got him all wrong .	 Do I ?
330  Dean Keaton was dead .	 Did you know that ?
334  Agent Baer .	 This is not what we discussed .
336  Ok ?	 I have a noon meeting , Baer .
339  He says they were buying --	 Dope , we know .
341  He needs guarantees ...	 What is he talking about ?
342  He says his life\' s in danger .	 He saw the devil .
343  Looked him in the eye .	 - I\' m on my way .
344  - No , no .	 Wait a minute .
345  Ask him to tell him what he told me .	 About the devil .
346  Who\' s the devil .	 Keyser Soze .
355  You tell me he\' s dead ?	 So be it .
357  It was the lawyer .	 What lawyer .
363  There was a lawyer .	 Kobayashi .
364  Is he the one that killed Keaton ?	 No .
365  But I\' m sure Keaton is dead .	 Convince me .
367  He had a good reputation .	 Seemed like a good guy .
368  Still , we should have known better .	 How\' re you doing ?
369  - Good .	 You ?
370  - Not bad .	 - How\' s it going , Fenster ?
371  No need to open it , right ?	 You must be Keaton .

375  We\' re on vacation .	 Oh well ... that\' s too bad .

412  He\' s a middle man for somebody .	 He doesn\' t say .
413  I don\' t ask .	 - You\' re fucking full of shit .

430  - Well , you can stop looking .	 It was no coke .
435  - What\' s the money for ?	 - He didn\' t know .

440  Who\' s Keyser Soze ?	 Oh , fuck !
442  What we need to do is think .	 Think back .
444  Come on , Dean .	 What the hell are we doing here ?
445  We\' re waiting .	 - Bye now .
446  - Sit down .	 - No , I\' m fucking bored --
449  A most unexpected benefit .	 I am Mr. Kobayashi .
451  - My employer requires your services gentlemen .	 One job .
452  One day\' s work .	 Very dangerous .
455  - I work for Keyser Soze .	 - Who\' s Keyser Soze ?
457  An order , actually .	 What do you mean , an order ?
461  The plane was carrying gold and platinum wiring .	 Also set for Pakistan .
466  You set up the line- up ...	 Yes .
473  You will repay your debt .	 All right , fuck the debt !
474  And fuck you !	 How do we know you work for Soze ?
483  A gift ... ... from Mr. Soze .	 Good day , gentlemen .
486  - No ... this isn\' t right .	 - I don\' t know .
488  Yeah , he did jobs for him .	 Indirect stuff .
490  Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .	 I don\' t know .
491  This is bad .	 That\' s bullshit !
494  There is no Keyser Soze !	 Who is Keyser Soze ?
495  He\' s supposed to be turkish .	 Some say his father was german .
497  You never knew .	 That was his power .
503  The Hungarians knew Soze was tough .	 Not to be trifled with .
510  And like that ... ... he\' s gone .	 Underground .
511  Nobody has ever seen him since .	 He becomes a myth .
513  No one ever really believes .	 Do you believe in him , Verbal ?
519  - What , on the street ?	 A few times .
521  Y\' know , shit like that .	 Could be an old badge .
524  I\' il run up the flagpole .	 I came clean .
529  I\' ve got immunity now .	 What can you possibly offer me ?
534  We can protect you .	 Oh , gee , thanks Dave .
536  Fuck you !	 You think you can catch Keyser Soze ?
542  That night we got the call .	 What call ?
544  We\' ve got to bury him .	 With what ?
545  With our hands .	 Oh , this is nuts !
547  Dig , you fucker !	 Hey , what are we going to do ?
550  You run ?	 I won\' t be digging a hole for you .
551  You got that ?	 This ain\' t my boy we\' re burying .
552  I don\' t owe anybody !	 Fuck you !
554  So fuck you !	 \' Cause now it\' s payback !
555  It\' s not payback .	 It\' s precaution .
556  You want payback ?	 You wanna run ?
557  I don\' t care .	 I\' m not doing this for Fenster .
560  And after they killed Fenster , nobody would run ?	 I wanted to .
561  I thought we could make it .	 Why didn\' t you say anything ?
562  Believe me , I tried .	 But Keaton wouldn\' t have it .
566  Nobody argued with Keaton .	 They just set their minds to whacking Kobayashi .
567  They\' re coming up .	 You hear me ?
568  He\' s coming up .	 He\' s on his way down .
569  Don\' t move .	 Press twenty .
570  Do it now .	 Move .
571  The answer is no .	 Mr. Soze will be most up --
576  My employer has made up his mind .	 He does not change it .
577  Neither do we .	 You got Fenster .
579  I believe you , Mr. McManus .	 I most sincerely do .
585  What did you say ?	 Edie Finneran .
586  She\' s upstairs in my office .	 For an extradition deposition .
588  No matter .	 Kill away , Mr. McManus .
589  You\' re lying .	 Am I ?
596  Now if you\' il excuse me , gentlemen .	 Geez .
597  It\' s a logistical nightmare .	 Close quarters .
599  Can we stealth these guys ?	 No .
604  Me too .	 Did you hear what he just said ?
607  News said it\' s raining in New York .	 What language is that ?
608  I don\' t know .	 Russian , I think .
609  Hungarian ?	 Package has arrived .
612  I\' m ready .	 I want you to stay here .
614  Find Edie , tell her what happened .	 Tell her everything .
615  She knows people .	 She knows what to do .
617  Please .	 Tell her that ...
618  Tell her I tried .	 McManus .
619  He\' s on his way .	 I\' m there .
620  Huh .	 Oswald was a fag .
621  Hi .	 How are you doing ?
622  Is there ... a problem ?	 Now ...
624  Elvis has left the building .	 Why didn\' t you run ?
628  Two guys from the Bureau just identified him .	 What else ?
632  Kobayashi .	 New York faxed me a copy of his testimony .
633  He was a rat .	 A big fucking rat .
635  Guess who he named in finale ?	 Keyser Soze .
636  There\' s more .	 I\' il tell you what I know .
638  Stay quiet !	 He\' s here !
639  I know he\' s here !	 That\' s him !
640  I\' m telling you that\' s him !	 I know he\' s here !
641  You don\' t understand .	 That\' s him ...
642  - Shut up !	 - That\' s him , you hear me ?
643  I\' m telling you it\' s Keyser Soze !	 - Where\' s Hockney ?
644  - I don\' t know .	 There\' s no coke !
645  - What ?	 - You heard me , you dumb fuck .
646  There\' s no coke !	 I checked the entire ship !
648  - There is nothing !	 Nothing !
649  You\' re fucking me !	 There is ... no ... fucking ... coke !
650  I\' m outta here .	 I told them nothing .
651  I swear .	 I told them nothing .
652  Please !	 McManus ?
653  What the fuck is going on ?	 Strangest thing ...
655  Wait a minute .	 I don\' t have a minute .
662  - I don\' t know what you\' re talking about .	 I did !
663  You\' re lying to me !	 You know .
666  You had a gun !	 Why didn\' t you help him ?
667  He was your friend !	 Because I was afraid .
668  Ok ?	 Afraid !
669  Afraid of what ?	 I know it was Keyser Soze !
672  All right .	 Let\' s get back to the pier .
673  Arturo Marquez .	 Ever hear of him ?
674  What ?	 No .
680  But Keaton did .	 Edie Finneran was ... ... Marquez \' extradition advisor .
688  No , sir !	 Why ?
689  Edie !	 I don\' t buy that reform story for a minute !
691  Because he was my friend !	 No , Verbal .
692  He wasn\' t your friend .	 Keaton didn\' t have friends !
694  It was his will .	 - Keaton was Keyser Soze !
698  What do you think about Keaton now , Verbal ?	 - Edie ...
700  The one man that could identify him .	 This is all bullshit ...
701  You said you saw him die ?	 Or did you ?
703  But you didn\' t see him die .	 I knew him .
704  He would never --	 He programmed you !
706  Where was the political pressure coming from ?	 Why were you being protected ?
707  It was Keaton !	 Immunity was your reward !
708  Why me ?	 Why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney ?
709  Why me ?	 I\' m stupid , I\' m a cripple !
710  Why me ?	 Because you\' re a cripple , Verbal .
711  Because you\' re stupid .	 Because you\' re weaker than them .
713  Come on , tell me the truth .	 It was all Keaton !
714  We followed him from the beginning .	 I didn\' t know .
715  I saw him die .	 I believe he\' s dead .
716  Oh , Christ !	 You\' re not safe on your own .
717  You think he\' s --	 Keyser Soze ?
718  I don\' t know , Verbal .	 Keyser Soze is a shield .
719  Like you said , a spook story .	 But I know Keaton .
721  No way .	 I\' m not bait .
722  I post today .	 You posted 20 minutes ago .
725  Turn states evidence .	 You might never see trial .
726  May be so .	 But I\' m not a rat , Agent Kujan .
727  Fucking cops .	 Excuse me .

729  One watch , gold .	 One cigarette lighter , gold .
730  And a pack of cigarettes .	 Thank you .
732  Just nothing .	 No matter .
734  I\' il find him .	 Waste of time .
735  A rumor is not a rumor that doesn\' t die .	 What ?
736  Nothing .	 Man , you\' re a slob .
739  You should see my garage .	 Convince me .
742  Think back .	 I\' m sure you\' ve heard many tall tales ...
743  - Bricks Marlin .	 - This isn\' t right .
746  - Some guy in California .	 His name is Redfoot .
747  - A gift ...	 - ... from Mr. Soze .
748  - Talk to me , Verbal .	 What about Redfoot ?
751  I know he was good .	 Tell me every last detail .
753  What about it , pretzel- man ?	 What\' s your story .
754  - There was a lawyer ...	 - What lawyer , Verbal ?

9  As she wheeled her wheelbarrow	 Through streets broad and narrow
10  Crying cockles	 And mussels ....

39  What a glorious feeling	 I\' m happy again
40  I\' m laughing at clouds	 So dark up above
41  The sun\' s in my heart	 And I\' m ready for love
42  Let the stormy clouds chase	 Everyone from the place
43  Come on with the rain	 I\' ve a smile on my face
44  I\' il walk down the lane	 With a happy refrain
45  And I\' m singing	 Just singing ... ... in the rain

332  The evil eye has done its work .	 My life is over .
334  Goodbye , Katrina .	 - You think it was Katrina .
336  How can you think so ?	 - You are bewitched by reason .
338  You\' d better learn it .	 Villainy wears many masks .

18  I chose it !	 Your daughter chose it .
21  So have I.	 Your journey was hard ?
22  But necessary .	 - It may already be too late .
24  Tonight at moonrise .	 My father says that good fighters make bad husbands .
25  - That depends .	 - On what ?
27  No , of course not .	 You\' re a warrior .

48  You\' ve come down from the Granite Mountains .	 Yes .
49  I am needed now .	 Father !
51  Nor have I become king on that day .	 I have no kingdom .
55  You must have help .	 I\' il find men on the way .

60  It doesn\' t really exist .	 It exists , up there .
65  I wish I knew .	 I cannot go with you .
69  - How will I know when ?	 - You\' il know .
73  There are kingly virtues other than bravery .	 Courtesy is one of them .
74  I\' m sorry .	 It\' s the thought of Lyssa there .

104  Faces that ugly could only belong to robbers .	 Don\' t worry .
106  100 is not enough !	 What have we here ?
107  A fighter !	 Besides , you\' re short about 90 men .
110  You\' re escaped prisoners .	 Every one .
111  Slaves , bandits , fighters and brawlers .	 Desperate men .
112  - As desperate as you\' il ever see .	 - Good .
113  Those are the kind of men I need .	 You need ?
121  - The profit\' s freedom .	 And fame .
122  Freedom ?	 But we have it .
129  The exact age .	 Torquil , you\' re growing old .
130  Your brain\' s softening .	 Nine men like you are worth an army .

162  I\' m Titch .	 That\' s not impressive , but adequate .
163  The Black Fortress .	 Where is it ?
164  Are you all right ?	 Yes .
166  Yes .	 Here .
168  Yes .	 In that place , he cannot oppose my vision .
169  Will you travel there with us ?	 It is in the Great Swamp :
170  A treacherous place .	 Our need is great .
172  It smells of death .	 Death and power are close cousins .
174  The profit of this journey .	 They\' re worth a fortune .
175  Maybe .	 To someone who\' s very nearsighted .
176  What ?	 But they were emeralds .
177  Hey , Rhun , emeralds .	 I swear it !

186  He visits the Seer sometimes .	 He doesn\' t speak much .
191  Quite so .	 You\' ve been with us for a long way now .
193  Join us , then .	 All men need company .
194  Yes .	 All men .
199  I only want one .	 That\' s a foolish wish .
200  And you , Rell , what would you wish for ?	 Ignorance .
201  No !	 - Nennog !
202  - Help !	 Help him !
203  The ground .	 It\' s sinking !
204  It is the power of the Beast .	 - Link up !
